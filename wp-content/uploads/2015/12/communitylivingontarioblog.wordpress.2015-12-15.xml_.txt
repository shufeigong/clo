		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Provincial Election Day </strong>in Ontario is <strong>Thursday, June 12, 2014</strong>. Please remember to get out and <strong>vote!</strong> For further information on <strong>WHO, WHEN, WHERE, HOW</strong> to vote, please go to the <strong>Elections Ontario</strong> website at <a href="http://wemakevotingeasy.ca/en/home.aspx">http://wemakevotingeasy.ca/en/home.aspx</a>.

Please also help Community Living Ontario to <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>#EndTheWait </strong></span>and sign our petition at <a href="http://chn.ge/1oUmxtd"><strong>http://chn.ge/1oUmxtd</strong></a><strong>   </strong>Please pass it along to friends, family, neighbours and co-workers. We’re happy to report that in just a matter of a few days, we already have 2,000 votes! Let’s keep those numbers of support climbing!

In this provincial election, we’re asking party candidates:
<blockquote><strong>"If your party is elected, would you commit to ending the wait for funding and supports for people who have an intellectual disability and stabilizing services by committing to the $810 million over three years promised in the proposed 2014 provincial budget?”</strong></blockquote>
Investment will:
<ul>
	<li>End the wait for daily living supports for children and adults which is almost 20,000 people long</li>
	<li>Begin to address the wait list of over 7,000 people who are waiting for support to live in a home of their own</li>
	<li>Deliver stability to agencies who provide front-line supports</li>
	<li>Develop new community-based services that support key life transitions</li>
</ul>
I have attached the Community Living Ontario’s <a title="Community Living Ontario Election 2014 Toolkit" href="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/TZ_CLO_Elect2014Tlkit_R2a.pdf">Election 2014 Toolkit</a>. This toolkit provides you with information on how to engage with your local candidates during the election campaign and how to share practical recommendations about crucial issues. This toolkit also serves as a quick reference guide that supplies you with information and facts that you can share with people you speak to, whether it be a current MPP, an election candidate, or someone close to you. It is the starting point of change!

This election toolkit also provides helpful information on simple ways that you can <strong>take action</strong> in your riding and in your community. Party leaders and local candidates need to hear loud and clear that voters are concerned about securing supports and #<strong>ending the wait</strong> for people who have an intellectual disability, and their families, and that they will heavily weigh party platforms when they vote.

Please also make sure to <strong>‘LIKE’</strong> us on <strong>Facebook</strong> and follow us on <strong>Twitter!</strong>

<p style="padding-left: 60px;">June 2, 2014</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Mr. Roy O’Leary</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">President</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Community Living Ontario chris@communitylivingontario.ca</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Dear Mr. O’Leary:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">As Premier, I became convinced it was essential for our Ontario Liberal government to address the urgent needs facing people with developmental disabilities and their families.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"> That is why I supported our 2014 Budget proposal to make the largest investment in developmental services <em>ever</em> -- $810 million over three years, to end the wait lists for direct funding programs.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">When we announced this funding, the Progressive Conservatives said it was a waste of money.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">The NDP said nothing, and their recent platform continues to be silent on services for people with developmental disabilities. Moreover, they opposed the most progressive budget in decades, which included the $810 million investment in developmental services.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"> If my government is given another mandate, we will absolutely reintroduce the budget and carry this forward as planned.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"> This new $810 million investment, which would have begun to flow as early as September, would:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"> <!--more--></p>

<ul style="padding-left: 60px;">
	<li>Expand direct funding programs to help individuals with developmental disabilities participate in their communities:</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">o    Eliminate waitlists for the for the Passport program over four years; and</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">o    Eliminate waitlists for the Special Services at Home program over two years.</p>

<ul style="padding-left: 60px;">
	<li>Expand individualized planning to help individuals with developmental disabilities transition to adulthood, find employment and achieve greater independence;</li>
</ul>
<ul style="padding-left: 60px;">
	<li>Provide residential supports to adults with urgent needs, including support to transition young adults currently receiving youth residential services to more appropriate adult services and supports; and</li>
</ul>
<ul style="padding-left: 60px;">
	<li>Expand cost-effective residential services and promote innovative community living solutions that support greater inclusion of people with developmental disabilities into communities.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">People with developmental disabilities rely on hundreds of agencies across Ontario for a wide array of safe, high-quality services. We will invest $200 million over three years for the front-line workers in these agencies to ensure families have the services they require in their communities.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Specifically, this investment will support the continued professionalization of the community and developmental services sector and support salaries and wages for front-line workers, including those in lower wage bands. It will support overall transformation of the sector by providing agencies with the flexibility needed to modernize how they offer the right mix of services to vulnerable Ontarians.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Only the Ontario Liberal Party has committed to making this investment in the developmental services sector. The back-and-forth from the PC party on this issue demonstrates a lack of commitment to helping the most vulnerable in society. The reckless cuts being proposed would hurt the services we hold dear and plunge Ontario back into recession. As for the NDP, make no mistake – they opposed the $810 million investment in this sector. They had the chance to support the most progressive budget in decades, and despite advice from the community they chose to force us into an unnecessary election. The opposition have put this funding at risk for political gain, and the people we serve are caught in the middle.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">I am very proud to have brought these long-needed improvements forward and, given the opportunity, I’m determined to see them through.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Thank you for the important work you and your colleagues do.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Please accept my best wishes.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Sincerely,</p>

Dear Chris,

I am pleased to be able to respond to your question on behalf of the Green Party of Ontario. Yes, the GPO, if elected, will commit to ending the wait for funding and supports for people who have an intellectual disability, and their families and stabilizing services by committing to the $810 million over three years as promised in the proposed 2014 provincial budget.

All the best,

June 01, 2014

&nbsp;

Roy O’Leary, President,

Community Living Ontario

240, Duncan Mill Rd. Suite 403

Toronto, ON M3B 3S6

&nbsp;

Dear Mr. O’Leary,

Thank you for your letter outlining Community Living Ontario’s priorities and concern for people with intellectual disabilities. The Ontario NDP shares your concern and is committed to investing to improve services and programs for those in need.

The Ontario NDP will provide the much needed funds to improve supports for those with developmental disabilities and their families. As part of our platform we are keeping the budget promises that we know are much needed and that we can deliver on.

In addition we will re-strike a Select Committee on Developmental Services to continue work on their important recommendations on how to improve these services. We will also work with families and stakeholders to implement their recommendations for families to have smoother and better access to services in the future.

In the 2014, budget the Liberals promised some much needed funding for developmental services. In fact, they made over 70 other promises, when they were not even able to keep three budget promises from last year. They are trying to escape their scandals by promising the moon and the stars and the NDP had some serious concerns about whether those promises would be kept – we’ve heard from people of Ontario who no longer trust them to keep their promises.

To answer your specific questions:

<strong>1. If your party is elected, would you commit to ending the wait for funding and supports for people who have an intellectual disability, and their families and stabilizing services by committing to the $810 million over three years as promised in the proposed 2014 provincial budget?</strong>

Yes

<strong>2. Our members wish to know, should you form government, what would you invest in the developmental services sector and over what time period?</strong>

We will invest an additional $810 million in the community and developmental services sector over the next 3 years.

Sincerely,

<a href="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/sig.png"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-61" src="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/sig.png" alt="sig" width="242" height="74" /></a>

&nbsp;

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

&nbsp;

QUEEN’S PARK – Immediately following Question Period, Christine Elliott asked for unanimous consent to restrike the Select Committee on Developmental Services so that the Select Committee can release its Final Report. However, the Liberal government voted against the unanimous consent motion.

&nbsp;

“I am disappointed that the Liberal government is stalling the release of the Report. Thousands of Ontario families are waiting for it”, said Elliott.

&nbsp;

The Select Committee on Developmental Services began its work last October and has travelled throughout the province, hearings from hundreds of individuals and families that there is a clear need for change in the system.

&nbsp;

“The Liberals have promised $810 million for developmental services in their budget. The Committee’s Final Report contains recommendations for improvements in the system, which will offer good value for money and ensure that individuals and families receive the supports and services they desperately need. I simply cannot understand why the Liberals refuse to acknowledge the work of the Committee,” concluded Elliott.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Our CEO <span style="color: #222222">Chris Beesley was interviewe</span><span style="color: #222222">d in today's Toronto Star article. The interview was in response to the long-awaited report from the Select Committee on Developmental Services. </span>

No more wait lists. One provincial minister in charge. And recognition that all people with developmental disabilities have the right to services throughout their lives. Those are the key recommendations in a long-awaited report released by the Select Committee on Developmental Services.

&nbsp;

“There is a lot we can work with in this report,” says Chris Beesley, CEO of Community Living Ontario, which serves about 12,000 developmentally disabled Ontarians, including about 9,000 in group homes at a time when 12,000 are waiting for beds.

&nbsp;

“Overall, we give it two thumbs up. Putting one minister in charge reflects the importance of a holistic approach,” Beesley added<strong>.</strong>

<strong>Quarterly Report - Q1 - 2014/2015</strong>

&nbsp;

<strong>Mission</strong><strong>:</strong>

Community Living Ontario is a province-wide confederation, rooted in a strong network of individuals who have an intellectual disability, families, friends, member organizations and community partners. It will be guided by, adhere to and strive to achieve its Goal and Vision in all its actions. Community Living Ontario advocates, promotes and facilitates the full participation, inclusion and citizenship of people who have an intellectual disability.

<strong>                          </strong>

<strong>Vision</strong><strong>:</strong>

Community Living Ontario envisions a society where everyone belongs, has equality, respect and acceptance. This gives people a sense of self-worth and opportunities for growth. The gifts, uniqueness and innate value of each individual are celebrated, supported and acknowledged as essential to the completeness of the whole community.

<strong> </strong>

<strong>Strategic Priorities</strong><strong>:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Lead a comprehensive advocacy initiative for reducing poverty, powerlessness and exclusion in the lives of people who have an intellectual disability.</li>
	<li>Strengthen the Community Living Ontario Confederation.</li>
	<li>Increase the voice of people who have an intellectual disability</li>
</ol>
<!--more-->

<strong>Note: </strong>For the full strategic priorities document, refer to: <a href="http://communitylivingontario.ca/about-us/strategic-priorities-2011-2016">http://communitylivingontario.ca/about-us/strategic-priorities-2011-2016</a>

&nbsp;

Quarterly Report – Q 1 – 2014/15

&nbsp;

As part of our efforts toward increased transparency and accountability, we at Community Living Ontario are pleased to provide our Q1 report for fiscal 2014/15.

This is a new initiative for us, so the format might change over time, but the intent will remain; to give our members and other stakeholders, a snapshot of the work we’ve done over the past three months.

The first quarter was a typically busy one. I was fortunate in being able to visit with 18 of our agency members, listening, commiserating, talking and celebrating with many people, including persons being supported, Board members, staff and parents.

We initiated a work group, comprised of senior MCSS staff, ED’s from several of the DSO offices, myself, Gord Kyle, and Sherri Kroll, ED of Community Living Middlesex. The goal of this group is to examine the current structure of DSO across the province, in order to streamline the process and improve communication. We’ve met on several occasions thus far, and are very encouraged with the direction of these discussions.

Our #EndtheWait provincial election package and accompanying petition were very well received and utilized by our members. The petition has managed to attract over 2700 supporters so far.

Our Passport Mentoring program continues to connect youth with an intellectual disability, to mentors in their community who are willing to share their experience and interests with youth who are exploring who they are and what they want to do when they’re finished school.

Plans are well under way for this year’s conference, entitled “Together We’re Better” which is shaping up to be one of our best ever.

As our mission states, “Community Living Ontario advocates, promotes and facilitates the full participation, inclusion and citizenship of people who have an intellectual disability.” Everything we do needs to support our mission, values and strategic priorities.

I encourage you to get a cup of coffee or tea, read the next 7 pages and tell us what you think.

Sincerely,

Chris Beesley

CEO, Community Living Ontario

&nbsp;

<strong> </strong>

<strong>Social Policy Department</strong>

&nbsp;

<strong>Addressing the Crisis being faced by Individuals and Families</strong>

&nbsp;

Community Living Ontario has been warning the government for years that a crisis is coming in the developmental services sector as thousands of individuals and families continue to wait for supports and services they need to live in the community.  We have called on government for significant new funding to drive a multi-year plan to address these challenges.  This spring we finally saw significant steps towards the kind of action we have been calling for.  The government’s Select Committee on Developmental Services released its interim report echoing the problems that Community Living Ontario and many others have been raising with government.  Additionally, the Government, in its 2014 budget promised $810 million in new funding to the sector over the next three years to begin addressing the problems identified.  While the provincial election delayed the release of the final report of the Select Committee and the implementation of the promised funds, we are confident that both will proceed and we will continue to advocate for this to happen.  We look forward to the opportunity to work with government to address the issues identified through the Select Committee and welcome new funding to help with this work.

&nbsp;

<strong>Addressing Issues with Developmental Services Ontario</strong>

&nbsp;

Community Living Ontario is committed to helping sort out the role that Developmental Services Ontario (DSO) plays in our communities.  Throughout the spring we met with representatives from the DSO Provincial Network and the Ministry of Community and Social Services to explore ways of addressing the challenges being experienced in the implementation of the DSO system.  We have explored mechanisms that would improve the experience of people and families who interact with DSO.  We are also working to help connect DSO better to community living organizations and other community supports.  We have also been exploring ways of formalizing a system of ‘Guided Personal Supports (GPS) that would ensure that people had a continuity of planning and access of supports throughout their life and would have access to the full range of opportunities and supports that our community has to offer.  This change would represent a significant step towards addressing the resolution passed by members at last year’s Community Living Ontario Annual General Meeting which calls on government to ensure life-long person directed planning and facilitation as a right to all who wish it.  Our progress to date has been shared with the Provincial Network on Developmental Services and we are looking to work with the government to broaden the discussion about these important matters with all stakeholders in the province and to begin to roll out positive reforms.

&nbsp;

<strong>Seeking Legal Reform for Supported Decision Making</strong>

&nbsp;

We have made excellent progress in recent months on our work to reform the legal frameworks pertaining to guardianship and substitute decision making. Over the past two years, Community Living Ontario has participated in two advisory groups with the Law Commission of Ontario, one looking at reforming the current legal framework for substitute decision making and the second looking at making it easier for a person to access the Registered Disability Support Plan when they are deemed to not be contractually competent to do so.  The RDSP group has wrapped up its work and a report with recommendations will be sent this summer to government regarding reform.  The second and broader process looking at overall substitute decision making has just completed a comprehensive public discussion paper that the Law Commission released in June.  We will continue to work with the Law Commission and the government to encourage the implementation of a legal framework for supported decision making that will benefit all who are at risk of being placed under guardianship.

&nbsp;

<strong>Administrative Justice Support Network</strong>

&nbsp;

We continue to build our capacity for supporting people who are facing tribunals or other administrative justice mechanisms.  Building on the launch last year of our comprehensive web resources that provide people information about a range of tribunals and other process, we are working now to build a network of mentors; people who have been through these processes in the past and are willing to stand beside others now facing a tribunal.  We held our first gathering of mentors in the spring to begin the orientation and training that they will need to be effective.  We continue to look for people who are interested in learning more about mentoring. Visit our Administrative Justice Support Network site here <a href="http://ajsn.communitylivingontario.ca/">http://ajsn.communitylivingontario.ca/</a>.  Through the Administrative Justice initiative, we are also proceeding with a project in collaboration with Community Legal Education Ontario. Beginning with a number of organizations in Southwest Ontario, we will be working to assist front-line workers in community living associations to be better prepared to provide advice to people they support about how to access legal and rights instruments, should a person ask them for assistance in doing so. We hope to expand this initiative to other parts of the province once it has been refined through the initial project.

&nbsp;

<strong>Doug Minty Inquest</strong>

&nbsp;

The inquest into the shooting death of Doug Minty by police wrapped up in June.  Community Living Ontario called for this inquest following the shooting in 2009 and acted as an intervener in the inquest.  Recommendations coming out of the inquest focused on helping police better understand that people who have an intellectual disability, like all others people, have unique and individual characteristics and personalities.  Through training and better communications, it is hoped that police will find ways of responding to calls that ensure the greatest degree of

Safety possible for all concerned. Community Living Ontario was retained and represented at the inquest by Iain Donnell of the Donnell Law Group and Orville Endicott, Legal Counsel for Community Living Ontario.

<strong> </strong>

<strong>Communications &amp; Marketing</strong>

<strong> </strong>

<strong>Community Living Ontario Web Site</strong><strong>:</strong>

As a priority vehicle for pushing out and receiving information and as a tool to better communicate with our priority audiences, we continue to revise and update the Community Living Ontario Web Site.  We have entered <strong>Phase l</strong> of a major review process to make it more relevant, user-friendly and accessible.  As part of this process, we’ve submitted a project proposal to <strong>MCSS</strong> to have the Community Living Ontario web site translated into French.  We’re hoping to coordinate the <strong>Web site Rebuild/Redesign Project</strong> to include partnerships with some of our association members who may also be contemplating a web site redesign.

&nbsp;

<strong>Social Media</strong><strong>:</strong>

We continue to expand our social media outreach and presence via <strong>Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn</strong>, and new <strong>Instagram</strong>, <strong>Pinterest,</strong> and <strong>Google+</strong> accounts.  Metrics (via <strong>Klout</strong>, <strong>Google Analytics</strong>, etc.) that have been set up and designed to measure the results of our  ongoing communications efforts will be compiled and shared with key internal stakeholders.  We’ve also created a <strong>new Community living Ontario blog space</strong> at <a href="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog">http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog</a> ; another pathway and tool designed to help encourage people to join the conversation.

&nbsp;

<strong>Sponsorship/Partnership</strong><strong>:</strong>

We continue to pursue sponsorship/partnership opportunities with key corporate sponsors.  Moving forward, we will need to continually create new and varying opportunities/experiences for sponsors to participate with us on internal and external facing Community Living Ontario communications products (e.g. newsletter, CL Ontario Web Site, public-facing outreach campaign, Conference materials, etc.).

&nbsp;

<strong>Internal Communications</strong><strong>:</strong>

The redesign and re-launch of a new <strong>CEO Weekly Email Update</strong> template is to be completed by early September, 2014.  The Community Living Ontario Communications Audit is completed.  Results of the communications audit will be shared with key internal stakeholders including:  Board, Senior Staff, and key stakeholders, etc.  Launch of the new <strong>L-Soft</strong> email distribution listserv platform is in progress.

&nbsp;

<strong>Conference 2014</strong><strong>:</strong>

We continue to explore, develop and introduce new integrated communications and marketing strategies and promotional materials leading up to Conference 2014, including: a digitally-based Conference 2013/14 online Flyer; an integrated social media strategy; video-taped CEO introduction to the Annual Report 2013/14 for CL Ontario website; a series of themed video clips; video –taped ‘thank you’ for conference attendees; hyperlinked banner created for CL Ontario staff email signatures, among others.

&nbsp;

<strong>Fundraising:</strong>

We’re hoping to coordinate the <strong>Benevon</strong> fundraising program to include other Community Living association members and proceed to <strong>Phase l</strong>.

<strong> </strong>

<strong>Media and News Releases</strong><strong>:</strong>

We continue to successfully extend and expand our reach out to key media outlets in order to help us communicate key messages to our external audiences.

<strong>Community Development </strong>

<strong> </strong>

<strong>The intent of the work done through our Community Development department is to design, facilitate, strengthen and build capacity in individuals, families, community groups and our local associations to build inclusive and welcoming communities, where we all belong.</strong>

<strong> </strong>

<strong>The last few months our activity and efforts have focused on:</strong>

<strong> </strong>

1)      <strong>Supporting the Council to build their capacity as a strong advisory body to the Community Living Ontario Board of Directors.  </strong>They have developed a new and more accessible election process, bylaws and protocols that address quorum, absenteeism, the relationship with the Board Liaison and the terms of the Council Appointee to the Board of Directors of Community Living Ontario.  The Council has also updated its local self-advocacy group data base, and is in the process of updating its orientation binder.  The Council is also expanding its networks and participated in forums such as the People First of Ontario conference, engaged in conversation with the “Freedom from Harm” working group and attended ODSP policy meetings.

2)      <strong>Supports to students thinking about graduation and what’s next</strong>.  Supporting students, their families and educators to explore new possibilities through the Passport Mentoring initiative. A summer newsletter recently available captures the stories of students trying new paths and looking at possible employment for the future including construction, working in a movie theatre and owning a landscaping company.  We were able to match 82 students with mentors in the last few months of school this year.

<strong> </strong>

3)      <strong>Supporting young leader’s mobilizing for change</strong>. Our youth leadership group have been actively planning the 6th annual Re: Action4Inclusion Youth Conference.  They have been working on the program that will engage youth in learning about collective and creative advocacy, self-determination and community development.  They work together to understand the principles of a civil society and what they can do to affect change with and on behalf of their peers.  We have also supported the youth to engage Michelle Dagnino (youth consultant) to work on a new project with them “Mobilizing Youth for Action”.  The last few months have been very busy – presentations at schools, supporting them  to bring the conversation of inclusion into their networks and  their communities, and participating in events such as the ,”Count Me In” – Canada’s biggest youth volunteer run event – promoting volunteerism and youth engagement. Our Re: action4Inc students have engaged many more thru their new twitter handle and Facebook accounts <a href="http://www.facebook.com/reaction4inclusion">www.facebook.com/reaction4inclusion</a> @R4Inclusion.  We continue to support local associations for Community Living with their youth efforts and recently partnered with Community Living York in hosting a brother and sisters retreat. We want to grow this area of work and are excited about the year ahead.

&nbsp;

4)      <strong>Continuing to create space and opportunity for families to grow and learn from one another. </strong> A group of parents who have participated in our family leadership weekends and a core group who we refer to as our Planning team, continue to meet and look at ways to learn from the series we have been hosting and to find ways to deepen the learning and opportunity for others

&nbsp;

5)      <strong>Working with our local associations and our national partner on new initiatives in employment</strong>.  We have hired a Labour Market Development &amp; Partnerships Manager and welcome Elisa Oncel to our team.  Currently the effort is to complete and orientation, needs assessment and then to develop a model and structure for the new Ready Willing and Able employment initiative here in Ontario.

&nbsp;

A busy few months – laying the foundation for an exciting fall and winter ahead.  Stay tuned.

<strong> </strong>

<strong>Membership</strong>

&nbsp;

<strong>Connecting with Members </strong>

During the first quarter of this year I visited 15 member organizations.  These visits included making presentations to Board members, attending Annual General Meetings, Anniversary Celebrations and special events and meeting with Executive Directors.

The focus of attention this quarter was visiting with members located in Northern Ontario.  Chris Beesley was able to join me on two separate tours.  We visited Community Living members in the towns and cities of Kenora, Fort Francis, Atikokan, Thunder Bay, Kapuskasing, Cochrane, Iroquois Falls, and Timmons.  I also attended the AGMs at two additional Northern organizations;   Community Living Greater Sudbury and Community Living North Bay. We are planning furthers visits this fall in order to see more of our Northern members

Additional organizations visited over this time period included Community Living members in Grimsby, Lincoln and West Lincoln, Haldimand, St. Catharines, Central Huron and Port Colborne-Wainfleet.  I also attended Regional Executive Directors Meetings and participated in teleconference calls with the Provincial Executive Directors Coordinating Committee, the Monday Morning Labour Calls and the Provincial Network Human Resources Committee.

I also met with a number of our members while attending the OASIS Annual Conference in London.  It was a fantastic event and I was welcomed warmly by the OASIS Board during their Gala Event.

<strong>Event Coordination and Membership Engagement</strong>

Three significant events were planned to encourage community and membership engagement.  Membership assisted with logistics, promotion and hosting of the events:
<ol>
	<li>The Select Committee Interim Report that was attended by over 50 people on site and reached over 50 locations remotely through webcast.</li>
	<li>Day at the Jays was again very successful with over 1000 attendees.</li>
	<li>The Benevon Introductory Session on Sustainable funding that attracted interest on site and through webcast.</li>
</ol>
<strong>Conference 2014</strong>

<em>Together We’re Better </em>

Planning is underway for the 2014 Conference and AGM being held September 24<sup>th</sup> to 27<sup>th</sup> in Richmond Hill and we are anticipating a successful event.  Most encouraging is the level of participation from our membership.  Community Living organizations taking part in sessions include Toronto, Elmira, Windsor, Peterborough, London, South-East Grey, Kenora, Grimsby Lincoln and West Lincoln, York South, Dufferin, Belleville, Prince Edward County and The Mills.

Additional sessions are being coordinated with New Vision Advocates, People First, Avon Maitland District School Board, The Provincial Network on Developmental Services and Community Living Education Ontario, The Council, and The Provincial Executive Director Coordinating Committee.

<strong> </strong>

<strong>Strengthening the Confederation Committee</strong>

Membership has provided staff support to the Strengthening the Confederation Committee (SCC). The SCC has begun reviewing existing committees, subcommittees, and working groups of the Community Living Ontario Board including The Executive, Nominations, Finance, Conference, Awards, Francophone Affairs, By-laws and Resolutions, and the Well Being Committee. Terms of Reference were reviewed and changes made as necessary and approved.  All changes and recommendations will be brought forward to the Community Living Ontario Board and if approved, shared with our members at the upcoming AGM in September.

In addition to the development of Strengthening the Confederation Committee, work continues to take place though its subcommittees including Nominations, Conference, and Awards.  Further work through the SCC will focus on criteria for individual and partnership levels of membership and the development of a work plan.

<strong>Financial Summary </strong>

Year to date results for the first quarter of 2014-15 are positive with net revenue of $571k versus a budget of $564k. The approved annual budget shows net revenue of $30k.

&nbsp;

The significant difference year to date is the assessment fees which are recorded when billed in April, but cover expenses which are spread evenly over the year. In addition we have unbudgeted administration fee of $42k being collected on the MCSS Pilot Project which was not included in the approved budget.

&nbsp;

All department spending is on target for the first quarter. There are no significant changes to approved budgets to be reviewed. The budget includes a salary and benefits for a fundraising position which has not yet been filled. As a result of the estates and bequests received this year, the overall targets in this department have been met.

The overall financial position of Community Living Ontario remains solid with net assets of $1.3 million versus $940k at March 31, 2014.

<strong>The Week in Review</strong>

I hope you all got your<strong> “Employment &amp; Modernization” proposals</strong> in by last Friday’s deadline.  We were pleased to support and partner with several of you.

Many thanks to <strong>Community Living Iroquois Falls, Kirkland Lake, Temiskaming South, Timmins</strong> and the<strong> Cochrane Temiskaming Resource Centre</strong>, for hosting <strong>Keith Dee and I</strong> and engaging in a great discussion of the issues.

Thanks also to the group from the<strong> ‘near north’ – Parry Sound, West Nipissing, North Bay, Almaguin Highlands, Huntsville, Mattawa </strong>and<strong> Muskoka South</strong> for allowing <strong>Kismet Baun and I</strong> to come and present on<strong> ‘Marketing Supports and Services in the World of Individualized Funding’.</strong>

It’s also been a challenging week.  The Ministry has told us that of the $200 million in wage funding for front-line staff, only $80 million will be annualized.  In conjunction with our Provincial Network partners, we will continue to seek clarification on this, as well as the rest of the $810 million funding envelope announced in the provincial budget.

<strong>Finally, please watch out for all the little ghosts and goblins prowling your neighbourhood tonight – </strong><strong>Happy Halloween!</strong>

<strong>Hello Everyone,</strong>

For those of you who may have missed the recent webinar that was offered by ISAC and the ODSP Action Coalition they have posted the presentation slides online. <a href="https://mail.communitylivingontario.ca/owa/redir.aspx?SURL=Ub532Yw0eRfDiUqg73PCGIaWY45X6hlGPZnfHd0n6HE-WWnAg-fRCGgAdAB0AHAAOgAvAC8AZQBiAGwAYQBzAHQALgBnAG8AdABlAG4AegBpAG4AZwAuAGMAbwBtAC8AdAAvAHIALQBsAC0AYwBoAGwAagB0AGoAZAAtAGkAaQBoAGsAaAB5AHkAaAB1AGkALQB1AC8A&amp;URL=http%3a%2f%2feblast.gotenzing.com%2ft%2fr-l-chljtjd-iihkhyyhui-u%2f"><strong> </strong></a><a href="http://yourlegalrights.on.ca/sites/all/files/webinar_files/Changes%20to%20employment%20benefits%20-%20ISAC%20Coalition%20Webinar%20-%20Dec%2011%202014%20-%202.pdf"><strong>You can view the slides here.</strong><strong> </strong></a>

As you know, the Ontario government announced in the 2014 budget that they are making changes to employment-related benefits provided through ODSP and OW. <strong>As part of these changes, they are eliminating the</strong> <strong>$100 Work-Related Benefit that people on ODSP currently receive, if they are working</strong>

The Work-Related Benefit is given to both people with disabilities on ODSP and members of their family. It provides $100 per month to each person in an ODSP family who has earnings from a job or a training program, or net earnings from self-employment. It is a mandatory benefit that people receive automatically without needing to apply.

As of April 1, 2015<strong>,</strong> working non-disabled family members of people on ODSP will stop receiving the benefit. People with disabilities on ODSP will stop receiving it as of October 1, 2015.

<a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/?sm=KZI0NJbqgBoIXOHy5rSHAQ%3d%3d"><strong>The ODSP Action Coalition has created a questionnaire and wants to hear from people on ODSP who are working and who receive the Work-Related Benefit.  </strong></a>

<a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/?sm=KZI0NJbqgBoIXOHy5rSHAQ%3d%3d"><strong>NOTE: </strong></a><strong>Please complete the questionnaire by January 30, 2015</strong><a href="https://mail.communitylivingontario.ca/owa/redir.aspx?SURL=O5kKGM-tPH-PFHhnXkHif9YbvDGuwekADKLdFH_ZoBz1SJndgOfRCGgAdAB0AHAAOgAvAC8AZQBiAGwAYQBzAHQALgBnAG8AdABlAG4AegBpAG4AZwAuAGMAbwBtAC8AdAAvAHIALQBsAC0AYwBoAGwAagB0AGoAZAAtAGkAagBkAHIAdAB5AGkAeQB1AGgALQBuAC8A&amp;URL=http%3a%2f%2feblast.gotenzing.com%2ft%2fr-l-chljtjd-ijdrtyiyuh-n%2f"><strong>. </strong></a><a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/?sm=KZI0NJbqgBoIXOHy5rSHAQ%3d%3d"><strong> </strong><strong>You can access the survey questionnaire here.</strong></a>

Results from the questionnaire will be used to lobby the government about the impact of making this cut and to explain why this is the wrong move.  For more information about the Work-Related Benefit and the changes that are being made to ODSP employment benefits, please see the following resources:

I think the $100 is an incentive for those who are truly trying. But hey who cares, the government thinks it their pocket is better with that money any way! I seriously think they should crack down on the people who gamble, smoke, and drink, not the ones who are really trying to make ends meet!!]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[As you make these decisions, it's apparent where you stand on compassion, visioning about the future of "marginalized" communities (no matter how it happens -- thru an act of nature, an accident, systemic design)....  
It's clear that social housing and social assistance will always be lacking.  It's clear that public funds will continue to be mismanaged, and go missing, without explanation.  There is more "awareness" about the cuts then there was for the "consultations"....  I got sicker trying to work for so little.  The clawbacks, and the impossible attempts to get employment supports leave me in a worse situation that I could have imagined. I thought that working would improve my self esteem, my quality of life, and my health.  No so, whilst working, I was never able to get the supports I needed to improve my health.]]></wp:comment_content>

<strong>Hello Everyone,</strong>

I want to share with you some important information that I recently received from <a href="https://mail.communitylivingontario.ca/owa/redir.aspx?SURL=gchQX5Kf-IOn0wV18BBOtgMidgci_Y5RamXnBcxC8-tIOAXAg-fRCGgAdAB0AHAAOgAvAC8AZQBiAGwAYQBzAHQALgBnAG8AdABlAG4AegBpAG4AZwAuAGMAbwBtAC8AdAAvAHIALQBsAC0AYwBoAGwAagBrAHQAbAAtAGkAagBkAHIAdAB5AGkAeQB1AGgALQBpAC8A&amp;URL=http%3a%2f%2feblast.gotenzing.com%2ft%2fr-l-chljktl-ijdrtyiyuh-i%2f"><strong>Jim and Marilyn Dolmage</strong></a> regarding the number of <strong>Class Action Claims </strong>submitted (figures as of December 8, 2014). They are:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Huronia Regional Centre</strong><strong> </strong>- <strong>1,723</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Rideau Regional Centre</strong> - <strong>1,095</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Southwestern Regional Centre</strong> -<strong> </strong><strong>678</strong></li>
</ul>
"This is an excellent result recognizing both the difficulty in finding and informing people. It appears to be about <strong>40%</strong> of the total class action members. The original goal for Huronia was at least 1,000 claims, so we are well past that figure," says Jim Dolmage.

"Credit is due, in large part to the lawyers for putting in place a well funded campaign. As well, the amount of free publicity through News Channels played a large role in making people aware. As well, your personal interest Chris and the involvement of <strong>Community Living Ontario</strong> to inform and encourage agencies played a major role. I know that your funding for Marie, Patricia, Marilyn and myself to travel and present also increased the claims numbers."

<strong>"Eighty per cent of all claims fall into the B category</strong> of more serious abuse. There continue to be a significant number of contested/incomplete claims and we will receive more information about resolutions in the near future. We'll keep you informed and appreciate the work that <a href="https://mail.communitylivingontario.ca/owa/redir.aspx?SURL=LDK02L_8Hbhdbwh9f3n-DiPtonqU-wh-GrbKDJel8W1IOAXAg-fRCGgAdAB0AHAAOgAvAC8AZQBiAGwAYQBzAHQALgBnAG8AdABlAG4AegBpAG4AZwAuAGMAbwBtAC8AdAAvAHIALQBsAC0AYwBoAGwAagBrAHQAbAAtAGkAagBkAHIAdAB5AGkAeQB1AGgALQBrAC8A&amp;URL=http%3a%2f%2feblast.gotenzing.com%2ft%2fr-l-chljktl-ijdrtyiyuh-k%2f"><strong>Brendon Pooran</strong></a> has done," continues Dolmage.

<strong>Happy New Year!</strong> ... I hope 2015 has started off well for you.

As we begin a new year on the calendar, I want to take the opportunity to share with you, a few brief thoughts for 2015: a New Year’s Resolution of sorts.

For the first and hopefully last time in my life, I’m going to quote George W. Bush. In a speech to the NAACP, he once referred to “the soft bigotry of low expectations”. To me, this describes where we are at in 2015, with respect to societal attitudes towards people with an intellectual disability. Prejudice may not be as overt as it once was; it may have gone “soft”, but it is still pervasive.

If we are to change these attitudes, we must promote the notion of “presumed competence”. Presume that everyone has abilities, skills and gifts to share. Presume that we each want to share our unique abilities, skills and gifts and presume that we all need support to be our best and to reach our potential.<!--more-->

Every year, each of us in the Community Living movement must renew our resolve to move the yard stick forward in the areas of community living that most affect our daily lives: where we live, where we go to school, what employment opportunities are available, and what opportunities exist to build friendships. By working together in these areas, we will make steady progress towards true inclusion.

Most New Year’s Resolutions are doomed to fail very shortly after they’ve been made. I believe most would have a much better chance of being successful if they were re-cast as ‘New Day Resolutions'. A whole year seems daunting and too much to tackle. So let’s take each day as a new chance to be successful in making small inroads towards inclusion. Together, we will turn 365 ‘New Day Resolutions' into an amazing year.

On behalf of our Board and our incredible staff, I thank you for your continued partnership and support.

				<title>Community Rallies Around Awareness Campaign</title>

This past week Kayla Marwick, a community activist and young leader helped to change the minds of many. Kayla with the help of her family, friends and community members, banded together with the goal of raising awareness about the “Spread the Word” campaign. This campaign was founded by Special Olympics and Best Buddies in 2009 with the intent of asking people to “Take the Pledge” and stop using the “R-word” ‘retard(ed)’. The campaign has received international recognition and has seen thousands of people from all over the world “Take the Pledge”.

Kayla Marwick is from a small city in Northern Ontario called Temiskaming Shores. For as long as she can remember, she has been an avid swimmer and trains 4 times a week with a local competitive community swim team. It was with her competitive swim team and also her connection with Special Olympics that Kayla found out about the campaign. “I have wanted to be involved with the campaign since I heard about it in 2009,” said Kayla. Late last year Kayla decided that it was time to become involved on a larger scale.

<!--more-->In late February, Kayla and her team took action and formally addressed the city council wearing “Spread the Word” T-Shirts. As a result, the City of Temiskaming Shores announced that March 4<sup>th</sup> would be recognized as “Spread the Word” day. As someone who has been directly affected by this language, this was a proud moment for Kayla. Hearing about the successful town council meeting, the local radio station as well as a local high school became involved by taking the pledge. Kayla’s mother Lynne spoke about the local community’s involvement – “Being a small community, we were able to build connections and partnerships. Now that we have been out there, we hope to solicit more support and self-advocacy from the community. Self-Advocacy is a skill that has to be broken down in steps,” said Lynne.

Kayla’s mother, Lynne, initially had concerns about Kayla’s involvement within the campaign. “During our discussion, we had to address that some people may not know what the R-word is, which would mean that Kayla would have to say it.  Some may not see this word as a problem at all.  As a mother and as any mother would, I initially wanted to shield her from any potential hurt this could cause. I realize now that guarding her would have inhibited her growth. On March 4th, I took a back seat to simply watch her carry herself within her various responsibilities on that day. Her advocacy skills, her confidence and her passion gave me hope and optimism for her future. She held her ground and didn't hold back, she took charge.   It was an emotionally draining day but a day that changed a community and inspired possibilities,” said Lynne. On March 4<sup>th</sup>, with the help of her committee, Kayla carried out 15 presentations at one of the local high schools.

In terms of future efforts, as a budding community activist, Kayla has expressed her desire to grow the campaign throughout her community next year. “I hope to have more committee members, students, and schools involved next year,” said Kayla. Overall, Kayla and her team were able to garner over 700 pledges towards the campaign and were recognized for their contribution on the Special Olympics Facebook page. . Kayla elaborated on her passion for the campaign - “We can all spread the word through society. It’s not just about the R-word. We should all be going in the direction of using more respectful words – maybe it’s just about a more respectful community.”

				<title>Ready, Willing &amp; Able Reaches Out to Potential Employers</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ilunch-photo.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-393" src="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ilunch-photo-300x225.jpg" alt="ilunch photo" width="300" height="225" /></a>Well aware that many members of its target audience are into technology, Ready, Willing &amp; Able (RWA) a national initiative hosted an Interactive Ontario iLunch on Wednesday, August 7, 2015 in Toronto to show tech companies the benefits of hiring people supported by Community Living Ontario with intellectual disabilities and autism.

The event was presented by Radha MacCulloch, Barrington Hector and Thivjan Tharma of RWA. Sarah Drew, CEO and Founder of Every1Games, which teaches video game development to people with autism, moderated a discussion panel consisting of HR managers from developers Big Viking Games and Gameloft.

Tharma began the day by discussing RWA and its core activities. “Our vision at Ready, Willing &amp; Able is to have an inclusive and effective labour market, where the employment rate of individuals with an intellectual disability and those on the autism spectrum is on par with the national average,” he said. He cited that the average employment rate for most individuals in Canada is 61%, while an ‘optimistic’ average for people with intellectual disabilities is 25%. ‘Optimistic,’ in this case, means that the statistic includes people in marginalized and unfulfilling jobs.

Employer attitudes, he said, are the biggest reason for this, and that is where RWA comes in. “We are here to support you guys as employers. So if you have any concerns, any issues regarding hiring inclusively, the business benefits of hiring individuals with intellectual disabilities or those on the autism spectrum, we’re the people to talk to you about that. As well, we’re here to help you with the transition of onboarding, hiring, and the whole process.”

RWA’s three main objectives, according to Tharma, are to connect employers with individuals with intellectual disabilities and autism and their community agencies; to promote general awareness among the public about hiring people with intellectual or related disabilities; and to be an employment service delivery organization by connecting people with new employers.

Taking over, Hector presented the business case for inclusive hiring. “Research has been happening for roughly the past three decades that continues to demonstrate that employees with disabilities and without disabilities are equally productive within work,” he said, matter-of-factly. He described a supervisor the group recently worked with who said that all of the people he hired through RWA were exemplary. That comes from traits like being methodical, conscientious, dependable, punctual, and consistent, all of which are common in the people the group supports.

Digging deeper, Hector also mentioned significantly-lower turnover rates, which mean fewer recruiting and training costs and less lost productivity, in addition to the fact that 90% of the general public has a more favourable view of companies who hire people with intellectual disabilities or autism.

He spoke to the ‘innovation advantage’ that hiring these people provides. These effects are twofold. First, it helps to maintain a company’s competitiveness, as “Customers want to see themselves represented in the businesses they support,” which employers can tap into with inclusive workplaces. Second, the creativity and flexibility needed to adapt to these diverse workplaces leads to innovation, according a Harvard study.

Wrapping up his section, Hector boldly proclaimed that “You’ll get employees who are Ready, Willing &amp; Able to meet your productivity. They will be able to stay with your company longer. They will help your company be more innovative and positively impact your brand image, as well as enhance the overall workplace. These are things that companies spend tens of thousands of dollars on annually, and this is something that happens naturally as a result of inclusive hiring.”

MacCulloch rounded out the presentation by discussing how RWA works. According to her, 25% of Canada’s labour force will be over 65 by 2031, and over 100,000 ITT jobs will need to be filled by next year. Mobile computing and apps are expected to add another 80,000 to that total.

To fill this demand, “We need to begin to look to untapped labour pools. So we know that people on the autism spectrum, individuals with an intellectual disability, they’re not only qualified to work in the ITT or interactive digital media industry, but that [they] also possess unique strengths, like Barrington spoke about, that contribute to a company’s productivity or a company’s innovative edge.”

She briefly listed several of the employment agencies RWA is partnering with to find people, describing their different engagement models. Some provide direct staffing support, while others offer IT consultancy services. RWA most closely models the former, but “Just as importantly, we are a highly customizable resource to employers, to companies, to business in providing in-house training…We work on a very individualized basis with businesses across different sectors, including interactive digital media, to identify what their needs are to tap into this labour pool.”<!--more-->

The group uses a process called ‘fit’ to ensure a positive experience for both employer and employee. This involves a comprehensive assessment of the position’s labour needs, a review of job descriptions to make sure everything stays relevant, and a review of the work environment. Then they bring the job descriptions to agencies who put candidates forward, and the hiring process can begin. “We are there for you as an ongoing support,” she reassured. “You don’t have to feel like you don’t know what you’re doing. You can always reach out to us for that kind of support.”

The luncheon then switched gears to a panel discussion with Chris Maheras, HR Manager at mobile game developer Gameloft, and Ana Ivanic, HR Manager at Big Viking Games. Both working at companies that have employed people with intellectual disabilities, they addressed questions from Drew on a range of topics.

“I don’t think it’s much different than recruitment for anyone else,” Ivanic offered. “Everyone has something that they struggle with, so being able to put things in place that don’t discriminate against anyone, regardless of who they are. It’s really important to consider that so that you’re really finding the best people for your company.”

Maheras agreed with this when answering a later question about how they handle the eponymous ‘crunch time’ that often pops up with software companies as deadlines loom. Referencing someone Gameloft recruited, he said “I had to remind him to take a lunch. This person was a programmer. Probably one of the greatest coders we’ve had in our organization. You had to tap him and be like ‘Hey, take a lunch.’”

While this dedication is an asset, it’s important that employers do encourage breaks like this. “It’s really important for us for our employees to have work-life balance,” Ivanic offered. “There’s only so much you can do in a 12- or 16-hour period and then go do it again in a 12- or 16-hour period, and then still be able to come up with things that are going to solve these magical problems.” Her company does not do crunch times, preferring to publish games when they are comfortably able to. Maheras’ organization incentivizes crunch time participation, but does not require it. Both make an effort to keep employees happy with extra activities; too, with Gameloft regularly scheduling social activities and Big Viking hiring a person whose title’s literally ‘Happiness Coordinator.’

The two chatted about many aspects relating to the minutiae of work, from having customizable training bibles that explain tasks in a way the employee understands; to the variable length of time it takes to complete the onboarding and training process. It’s important to figure all of these areas out, though, as Ivanic pointed out “Replacing people is really expensive. You’re much better off spending an extra week helping someone out, than it is to completely dump them into the water, hope they swim, and if not, try to find somebody else.”

Rounding out the day, Tharma asked for some candid input from the audience about a couple of key issues. He first asked what concerns attendees had about hiring inclusively. A woman who owns a small business with no HR department was willing to hire someone, but she didn’t have the capacity to train. “I think that’s where we can come in as an extension of your company’s HR. That’s something [where] we can come in and do the assessment on the jobs that you’re looking at, some of the roles you’re looking at, some of the strengths and qualities you’re looking for, and then be that feeder with the pool that we have of individuals to support that.”

Another woman was simply concerned about the large number of people who don’t even get a diagnosis until later in life, though MacCulloch stressed how much RWA is attempting to combat this through promoting awareness.

The other major question revolved around what supports the companies would want in order to heighten inclusion. “Education,” one man put it, simply. “I think that we’ve been talking about ASD and intellectual disabilities. Define what that is. Understand specifically what are some of the combinations that you might incur.” Another suggested it would be helpful if a potential employee brought in a portfolio of previous work, saying that he doesn’t care so much if they have ten years’ experience or none—he’s more interested in the quality of their work and how compatible their personalities are with the workplace.

“We really encourage you to keep the conversation going,” said Hector, in summary, “and get in contact with us about your hiring needs and your onboarding needs.”

				<title>Family Resource Centre Opens</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="color: #000000;"><img class="alignleft" src="http://i4.createsend1.com/ei/r/E6/834/202/csimport/clps.213710.jpg" alt="" width="354" height="210" />A Family Resource Centre is now available for people with an intellectual disability in the West Parry Sound District.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The centre is located at 8 McNaughton Street in Parry Sound and is commonly referred to as “The House on the Hill.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Renovations on the house began earlier this June with work including the revitalization of the sensory room, the addition of new sensory equipment, respite rooms, computers, comfortable furniture and meeting rooms.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The centre was officially unveiled to the public during two open house sessions hosted earlier this month.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“We are now once again able to offer centre-based respite for our families. We have two rooms with pullout sofas, which are available for respite for families to book,” said <strong><a style="color: #0074c8;" href="http://eblast.gotenzing.com/t/r-l-zhkkrg-l-q/" target="_blank">Community Living Parry Sound</a> </strong>Executive Director, <strong>Jo-Anne Demick</strong> at the open house.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“They are being used as meeting rooms as well. We have two computers which are available for families…which will have access to high speed internet to do research, fill out applications and for some it is even working with a therapist to learn new programs which can be used by their son or daughter.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The open house also featured a presentation by <strong>Karen Neary</strong>, a child development consultant opening a practice in Parry Sound. Neary, who is in the process of relocating with her family to Parry Sound from Stratford after being cottagers for years, said she was inspired to go back to school to obtain a doctorate in developmental psychology after her son was diagnosed with autism.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“When my son was diagnosed with autism it was probably about 16, 17, maybe 18 years ago, I didn’t really know anything about autism, didn’t know anybody with autism and certainly didn’t know how to help him,” said Neary.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“We were living in a really small town and there wasn’t any resources and there wasn’t anybody there to sort of help me navigate the system so I sort of had to travel around and try to figure out everything that I could do, go to workshops, read books, do research, try to figure out how I was going to help my son.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Neary explained it was a difficult time because as a parent she was trying to cope with the diagnosis her son had received, was partially in denial and grieving, all the time trying to help her child.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“I decided to go back to school to get a PhD in developmental psychology mostly because I felt like I really needed to learn typical child development so I could figure out ways to help kids with disabilities to reach their milestones as well,” said Neary.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Neary is dedicated not only to children but also to the families, as she understands firsthand the support that is needed, especially in a small community.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Neary is currently operating out of the Foley Community Centre and believes in a multi-disciplinary approach, collaborating with a variety of physicians and agencies. In her move to Parry Sound, Neary will be working closely with Community Living Parry Sound.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The Family Resource Centre initiative is a response to what families in the West Parry Sound District need and want and in order to be successful, engagement and feedback is needed from people it is met to serve along with the broader community.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">If you would like to tour the Family Resource Centre and provide input, contact Community Living Parry Sound at 705-746-9330, via website at <strong><a style="color: #0074c8;" href="http://eblast.gotenzing.com/t/r-l-zhkkrg-l-a/" target="_blank">www.clps.ca</a></strong>.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[“This is my life now.”

That’s how Luciano Contini describes his role as parent and advocate for his six-year-old son, Peter.

The self-employed Human Resources Consultant and Vice President of Community Living Ontario says his son’s birth has brought many joys and challenges to the family, which includes eight-year-old son, John, and wife, Julie.

Luciano became involved with Community Living Ontario as a prior presenter on advocacy at the Confederation’s Conference and AGM; he recently completed his first full year on the Board. He says the organization’s mandate “matches my vision of inclusion for my son.”

“I want him to live the life that he wants to live and not have his life or his environment dictated to him; not having him forced into a template because he is challenged. Inclusion is all about having him in the community as a participating member of society, living the life the way he wants to live it,” he adds.

The Continis know travelling the path toward full inclusion is a lifelong and often frustrating process, but they are undaunted.

For example, finding a fully-inclusive school environment for Peter in the public or Catholic school systems in their hometown of Sudbury was not possible. The public system wasn’t ready for him, says Luciano, and the Catholic board said Peter could attend a regular class, but any time he would require personal care, Luciano or Julie would have to leave work and assist him themselves.

“That flies in the face of respect, dignity, human rights and the rights of the individual. He’s entitled to be in a class with his peers.”

He knows their choice to enrol Peter in a Montessori school, which they believe is built on inclusion, is not an option for many parents, but there’s a stark difference between the traditional school boards in Sudbury and Montessori.

At his son’s school, “I call myself Peter’s dad, because when kids see Peter they don’t see a kid with Down syndrome; whereas in the public system they see a kid that looks different and possibly expectations are that they should be segregated because the kids who look different are segregated in schools. [The children at Montessori] don’t see Peter at all that way. This is human nature. Peter is a friend. They replicate the behaviour being modelled by the educators – compassion, patience, and they redirect Peter correctly because they have learned to do so correctly.”

Still, the Continis haven’t given up on the public school system.

“We’re not there yet, but that is kind of in the plan. We’ve put them on notice that Peter is coming. None of them said they are prepared for Peter. None of them said ‘we are ready to go with Peter today.’ But they know that we are going to see them again and that Peter is on his way in. They have time to prepare.”

Luciano says other parents who are trying to have their child accommodated in a regular classroom have told them that the public school board knows “‘about you guys and they know you are coming.’ If they didn’t have a good feeling about us, I’m not sure they would have said that. I think they know we are advocating and to expect Peter because he belongs in a class with his peers."

Peter’s parents say he is enjoying the life they want for him, because of the environment he is in right now.

“I’m not sure that in a segregated school system how many children with special needs can say they get up to 20 kids to a birthday party, because he is included and he has that many friends, and that’s what we want to see.”

Luciano and Julie are actively engaged with Community Living Ontario because they know how the organization is advocating for Peter and people with an intellectual disability across Ontario.

“Younger families like ours should get involved because it’s just as important to guarantee inclusion for adults as it is for children. For me, it is critical for the sustainability of inclusion to start with children.”

The attitudes of many today toward people with an intellectual disability are still negative, he acknowledges.

“Instead of seeing what people are capable of, we slide into caretaker mode and say 'they can’t take care of themselves' and 'they are a burden on society' and 'let’s just make sure they are safe and that’s good enough.' I think a lot of Community Living associations will say ‘we are great at keeping people safe and fed’ but we need to do more. We need to help these people live the lives they want to live, the good life.”

But the couple says this is a path they are walking, not just for their son, but for other families and that young families “need to understand that working for full inclusion is a lifelong process.”

Advocating for full inclusion is one of the battles that Community Living Ontario needs to continue, they say. As Luciano notes, “That’s an area where Community Living Ontario should be more than happy to work itself out of a job. Get society to a point where we don’t need to convince people of inclusion anymore because it is obvious.”

Julie, who works in human resources, labour relations and recruitment at Health Sciences North in their city, is a member of Community Living and President of the Down Syndrome Association of Sudbury.

“As a member, I like to hear about what’s happening now and what’s going to happen in the future,” she says.

“The wealth of information you can get through Community Living - you can’t get that anywhere else. It is knowledge; it helps you in whatever barriers you are trying to overcome now regardless of how old Peter is. It is helping in preparation for his future, and knowledge is helpful. It is nice to know it is there. It is nice to know the services. It is nice to know what fight they are fighting, and what battle they are going after. And it is great to know all the successes that have been happening for decades.”

				<title>2015  Provincial Budget Recap</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Yesterday’s Provincial Budget release focused on fiscal restructuring – with an emphasis on several initiatives that would see the increase of skill building and employment, addressing issues of provincial financial security and improvements to infrastructure. Last year was a significant win for our sector which was promised $810 million over the next 3 years. This year focused on the progress being made as a result of last year’s investment.

We were very pleased to see one of our members <a href="http://eblast.gotenzing.com/t/r-l-quuykky-iihkhyyhui-k/"><strong><span style="color: #0074c8">LiveWorkPlay </span></strong></a><a href="http://eblast.gotenzing.com/t/r-l-quuykky-iihkhyyhui-u/"><strong><span style="color: #0074c8">being mentioned in the budget</span></strong></a> as an outstanding example of the many ways in which last year’s investment has enabled our sector to provide better services.<a href="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/2015budgetsousa.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-188 size-medium" src="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/2015budgetsousa-300x224.jpg" alt="2015budgetsousa" width="300" height="224" /></a>

The <a href="http://eblast.gotenzing.com/t/r-l-quuykky-iihkhyyhui-o/"><strong><span style="color: #0074c8">Ontario Youth Jobs Strategy</span></strong></a> was implemented in 2013 as an effort to reduce youth unemployment in Ontario which currently sits at 14.9%. The program has been renewed with $250 million committed over the next two years. However, the focus seems to have shifted on youth who struggle with accessing the program. While no specific details have been given in terms of how the program will be reworked – the government recognizes the critical need of support and skill development programs for the most vulnerable job seekers. The Youth Job Connection is an intensive employment support program to help youth who experience multiple barriers to employment – no specific details were released about the framework of this program.

<a href="http://eblast.gotenzing.com/t/r-l-quuykky-iihkhyyhui-b/"><strong><span style="color: #0074c8">ODSP Income Support </span></strong></a>and Ontario Works rates will both be increased by 1% commencing October for ODSP recipients and November for Ontario Works recipients. Ontario Works adult single rates will also be topped up by just over $18 so that the total combined increase, including the 1% will equal $25 per month. The inadequacy of ODSP income support continues to be a concern for people with disabilities and Community Living Ontario and will remain a focus of our advocacy.

Aside from the renewal of the Ontario Youth Jobs Strategy which will now place a larger focus on youth with several barriers to employment and the annual increase of ODSP supports - there are no major changes in this year’s Provincial Budget.

Community Living Ontario kicked off Community Living Month by asking people the question, What does community living mean to you? The responses we received reached far beyond our expectations; the interest from associations, members, and self-advocates from around the province resonated throughout the month. Community living is about creating a truly inclusive society that reflects the abilities of every individual. Now, as May comes to an end, we have recognized the passion so many of you share for building a society that is inclusive to everyone.

Earlier this month, we were made aware of a group called <a href="http://eblast.gotenzing.com/t/r-l-ajkhktl-ityujttrty-yu/"><strong><span style="color: #0074c8;">Media Explosion</span></strong></a>, a group of five self-advocates from Windsor, ON, who had an interest in storytelling.

“Media Explosion is about telling people our stories as well as making sure others’ voices and stories are heard,” said Paul, one of Media Explosion’s founding members.

“The group was hand selected because of their willingness to stand up and speak out, their interest in journalism, as well as their passion for making sure others’ voices are heard,” Kitty Peguese, staff support for Media Explosion.

All of the stories Media Explosion writes are shared and posted on their Facebook page, which you can find <a href="http://eblast.gotenzing.com/t/r-l-ajkhktl-ityujttrty-jl/"><strong><span style="color: #0074c8;">here.</span></strong></a>

“We want Media Explosion to continue to grow. Our message is that there are a lot of stories to be told, and we want to be the medium that carries the message," said Paul.

We look forward to hearing more about this great initiative in the future.

Although the celebration of Community Living Month is coming to an end, we encourage our members, associations and self-advocates to continue to send us stories about the many ways people are Inspiring Possibilities.

Community Living Ontario would like to sincerely thank everyone that made an effort to raise awareness during Community Living Month.

We sit down with a couple of the managers and ask questions to know if [the candidates] would be good assets to Community Living Fort Erie. I don’t make the final choice, but I have input in the interview process.”</p>
<p style="color: #141823;">“The Self Advocacy Committee gives people with disabilities a voice.

They help me get out there and to explore any activities that might be happening.

“I’m a referee in pro wrestling. I’ve got a lot of matches under my belt, 30 or 40 matches over three or four years. I have refereed great men and women in the sport; they’ve got the passion, the drive, you name it. It’s fascinating refereeing a 300-pound guy versus a 200-pound guy and how it works.”

“They had an independent show – TWA – and they came every other Sunday. I was there watching it and then I started asking questions about how to become a referee."

“When you first start out [as a referee], it’s intimidating because you don’t know what to expect with the guys or the girls, whoever you’re refereeing. It’s interesting and I’m learning new things every time I’m in the ring.”

“In August, I’ll be heading to Newfoundland. That’s where I’m originally from. I’m going there to visit family and friends because it’s been a while. That’s been one of my dreams, just to get down there to visit them.”

<strong>Living in Community</strong>
<p style="color: #444444;">Have you ever thought about what your life would be like if you had been born with a developmental disability?  Not likely, why would you? Families and people who support those with developmental disabilities think about the people they love and support every day; but I never did because I never had to. Not really.</p>
<p style="color: #444444;"><a href="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Blending-Art-Show-Feb-2015-030-717x600.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-215 size-medium" src="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Blending-Art-Show-Feb-2015-030-717x600-300x251.jpg" alt="Blending-Art-Show-Feb-2015-030-717x600" width="300" height="251" /></a>When I graduated with my teaching degree five years ago I had a good working knowledge of special education and the variety of ‘special’ youth I may be asked to educate. That helped me understand the medical causes of different behaviours but it did not make me think about what my life would have been like if I, or one of my kids, had been born with a disability.</p>
<p style="color: #444444;">My brother started showing signs of schizophrenia at the age of 18. He was not on medication, his behaviour was frightening and it was far beyond the ability of my family to know how to cope with him.  Fortunately, in time a social worker helped him find medical help, housing and some safety. His life today at 56 is a happy one. He lives in his own one bedroom apartment with his companion dog Buddy, works, and enjoys a family that love and talk to him all the time. He has a few friends other than those who are paid to support him.  My brother, paranoia and all, is one of the finest men you could ever want to know; a man of great character. His ‘behaviours’ limit the amount of friends in his life and the amount of time people want to spend with him. I find this sad to think about but, compared to the people with schizophrenia that I once saw locked in small white rooms on Queen Street West – Sam has a real life.</p>

<strong>Community Living Prince Edward Hosts Mayor’s Breakfast, Celebrates Milestone</strong>

The message of inclusion for all people was delivered loudly and proudly by Community Living Prince Edward, as the association hosted its first ever Mayor’s Breakfast yesterday to kick off Community Living Month.

Prince Edward County’s Mayor Robert Quaiff officially proclaimed May as Community Living Month. The organization’s Executive Director, Susan Treverton, highlighted the need to increase the capacity of communities to embrace and welcome people of all abilities.

"Community Living Prince Edward believes that our community should be a place where ALL people have the opportunity to fully and actively participate in the life of their community,” said Treverton. “We make conscious decisions to ensure our resources are in alignment with support for people versus programs which in turn increases the opportunity for people to become engaged in the life of the community and its economy."

Board President Henry Morrison, County Advocate Dereck Simpson and Lee Swackhammer, a parent with the Family Engagement Network, also shared a common message of inclusion and the importance of belonging.

In addition, this year is of particular importance to Community Living Prince Edward as they celebrate 50 years of service in their community. Established in 1965 by a group of dedicated parents, the organization has continued to grow and develop in response to the wishes, goals and desires of people they support.

“I’m involved with Community Living Ontario to make sure that self-advocates are included, able to achieve their hopes and dreams, and able to speak and make decisions for themselves.”

That’s where my motivation is.”

“To me, Community Living means building more inclusion, instead of exclusion; to have people with intellectual disabilities be able to get out there; we all work together with one voice.”

“My goal would be to go to school and become a social worker or PSW because a lot of people say I’m good at that. I don’t mind helping people because I like to see the smiles on their faces.”

I thought that it was just me in this world that had a disability. I started meeting new people and making new friendships.”

“Community Living to me means that we are all equal. We are all gifts. We all have things that we can share. We can all be accepted for what we have. We’re not disabled, we all have abilities.”

“We should look at the things that we can do and not focus on the can’ts. We should be encouraging people to do things.”

“I have a goal to go on a vacation. I have been working towards it by raising money for myself. I’ve been saying it for a long time, but I keep saving money to actually make that dream come true for myself. I also had the dream of going back to school, and I actually made that dream come true. I’m currently taking the CICE program at Conestoga College.”

“I am working with my fellow self-advocates from Community Living North Halton to mark Community Living month. We’re having a Spring Fling dance in Milton on May 2nd. We’re going to have people come out and enjoy themselves for the evening, with lots of dancing and food.”

“We’ve been doing this for several years now” said Middlesex Community Living Executive Director Sherri Kroll. “It’s our way of kicking off Community Living month. For the month of May, our flag flies high atop the Town Hall flag pole for everyone to see”. The Strathroy-Caradoc Town Hall is situated in the heart of downtown Strathroy in a busy traffic area. The flag is a visual reminder to all who pass it that every community member is valued and appreciated for the skills and talents they possess. Also in May, Middlesex Community Living hosted the 14<sup>th</sup> Annual Mayor’s Breakfast. On May 20<sup>th</sup>, Middlesex Community and Strathroy- Caradoc Mayor Joanne Vanderheyden welcomed over 100 guests. Guests enjoyed a delicious breakfast of sausages, bacon, eggs, pastries, yogurts, juice and coffee. Mayor Vanderheyden addressed the group about the importance of building a strong and inclusive community where everyone was not only welcome but supported to grow and attain a prosperous quality of life. The members of Middlesex Community Living have ideas of their own on how to celebrate and promote Community Living month. In an effort to build awareness and give back to their community, members will be performing random acts of kindness throughout the month.

On Friday May 22, Community Living Essex County held their <strong>10th Annual Mayors Luncheon.</strong> Each year, this luncheon is held to celebrate Community Living month in the province of Ontario, while serving as a public awareness opportunity for the communities we serve. The theme for 2015 was celebrating Ambassadors of Community Living Essex County. Municipalities , area businesses, service clubs, media, from across Essex County attended with CLEC volunteers, Board Members, direct support employees, Managers and Directors.

With employment as a central theme, the audience heard presentations from <strong>Tammy </strong>and<strong> Paul</strong>, two direct support employees who provided the audience a window into their world. Many times direct support employees are the first ones to make direct contacts to resources in the community - serving as our first ambassadors to the community. <strong>Eva</strong>, a self advocate spoke passionately about her experiences being employed, receiving her first pay cheque and the satisfaction she felt in knowing she was contributing to her municipality as a tax payer. Next, <strong>Rosa Amicarelli</strong>, Manager of Community Living Supports outlined the new <strong><em>“First Choice – Employment”</em></strong> program and its importance in promoting the hiring of people with disabilities to local employers and municipalities.   Finally, <strong>Mike Siblani</strong>, Owner/Operator of several local Little Caesars Pizza outlets provided a positive and personal testimonial about his experiences as an employer who has hired people with intellectual disabilities. The event was extremely successful with 130 people in attendance, celebrating our community ambassadors.

Guest speakers Julian Escallon, Self-Advocate, and Jeff Dobbin, Partners for Planning Executive Director, joined the Parry Sound community to celebrate <strong>inclusion </strong>at the 9<sup>th</sup> Annual Community Living Parry Sound Breakfast with the Mayor. Jeff Dobbin provided an historical context of what life was like for people with an intellectual disability in the 1970’s when institutionalized living was the norm. As a sharp contrast to that old, outdated reality Jeff proudly introduced his friend Julian Escallon to demonstrate, in lived experience, what is meant by the term ‘living a meaningful life in community’. Julian is living proof that a person born with Down’s syndrome is an asset to their community and is able to make as big a difference to the world as any other person can.  It was an uplifting and joyous event attended by over 100 people including businesses, residents, families, politicians and people served by Community Living Parry Sound.  Local restaurant owner Mike Reeves of Wellington’s Pub and Grill donates the entire breakfast buffet and venue as their meaningful and generous offer of support for our goals of social inclusion.

				<title>Why You Need to Become a Volunteer Member of Community Living Ontario’s Board of Directors</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>Community Living Ontario is actively seeking dedicated volunteers who possess varied backgrounds and perspectives to join its Board of Directors. </em>

<em>The following is David Barber’s reflection of his time as a Member and Past President of Community Living Ontario. We thank David for taking the time to share his thoughts.</em>

After being elected President of Simcoe Community Services in Barrie, I was asked to become the Regional Representative in my area for Community Living Ontario. I agreed to do this and Keith Powell, the new Executive Director, and I started on the Community Living Ontario Board at the same time; it was an amazing partnership that we established together. At the time, Community Living Ontario was required to re-invent itself, moving from a resource rich environment to one of providing broader services to the federation based on a new level of membership assessment.

[caption id="attachment_236" align="alignleft" width="300"]<a href="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Barber-.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-236" src="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Barber--300x253.jpg" alt="The Ontario Medal for Good Citizenship Investiture Ceremony, Thursday, January 31, 2008.

The Honourable, David C. Onley, Lieutenant Governor of Ontario, David Barber and the Honourable Michael Chan, Ontario Minister of Citizenship and Immigration.[/caption]

In 2001, after some 11 years of providing no additional resources to the Developmental Services Sector, Community Living Ontario worked with MCSS Minister John Baird and Finance Minister Jim Flaherty to secure 210M in new funding for services and supports to people with an intellectual disability; the largest sum of money allocated to the Sector until the recent 810M allotment in 2014. At the Community Living Ontario AGM/Conference in Ottawa, Minister Baird attended and received a standing ovation from approximately 1,000 elated federation members. This was the highlight of my Presidency at Community Living Ontario and something I am very proud of. We did not do it alone; certainly other organizations supported our efforts to convince government to expand our resources. However, Community Living Ontario and member associations were the leaders. They had BRANDED themselves in the mind of the public and the Provincial Government as the primary voice for people with an intellectual disability and they had successfully lobbied every single MPP to support their work.

The above is only a fraction of what we achieved over my four years as President of Community Living Ontario. The thrill was in working with so many dedicated and committed parents, children, agency Executive Directors and Presidents who bought in to our plan and self-actualized it. Working with some of the brightest people in our Province with vision, patience, passion and a can-do attitude made our success all the more sweet. I made many close friends who stood with me and helped me to make a difference; they were unwavering in their faith and confidence in me and I am eternally grateful for those rich relationships and the sense of accomplishment of a shared experience. It was not only getting the job done, it was the journey and the joy and disappointment shared along the way.<!--more-->

There is still much work to be done and Community Living Ontario stands alone as the chief advocate for people with an intellectual disability. The work can be challenging and the process by which a grassroots organization achieves consensus and the speed with which it makes decisions may be challenging to some. Yet, the rewards of comradery, a shared vison and the ultimate success that is achieved for people who through no fault of their own, find themselves in need of our support, is worth the effort.

Join the Community Living Ontario Board of Directors as a volunteer and make a difference in this province, in this country and this world by advocating for the rights of people with an intellectual disability. You will be glad that you did.

<strong>David Barber</strong>

<strong>Past President</strong>

<strong>Community Living Ontario</strong>

				<title>Remembering Judith Snow</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It is with a deep sense of loss that we announce the sudden passing of Judith Snow on May 31st, 2015. Judith’s connection to the community living movement over the past 35 years is profound, and will form its own chapter in our history. She is truly irreplaceable.

Judith’s dreams for herself were unlimited by her disability and she committed herself utterly to them. She is the first person in Ontario to have individualized funding and the person <a href="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/judithsnow.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-253" src="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/judithsnow-300x200.jpg" alt="judithsnow" width="300" height="200" /></a>around whom the first circle of support was created. Judith was part of a group that created an intentional community so that people with disabilities could have a home of their own. Some time later Judith left that community to realize her dream of home ownership. Though she loved her house, when she envisioned the ‘World Peace Through Inclusion Tour,’ Judith sold it and bought a specialized RV in which she travelled across the United States and Canada. When she dreamed of being an artist, Judith became a founding director of the Laser Eagles, an engagement that led to her paintings being featured in an exhibit at the Royal Ontario Museum entitled “Who’s Drawing the Lines: The Journey of Judith Snow.” More recently, Judith worked on the creation and presentation of “The Book of Judith,” an interactive performance that challenged the way audiences think about disability. These are but a few of the many ways Judith expressed herself and don’t begin to touch on the relationships she built through the years and across the planet.

Though change was a common theme in Judith’s life, every endeavour was connected in one way or another to illustrate the capacity of people with disabilities to contribute to their community. Early in her career, Judith wrote <em>What’s Really Worth Doing and How To Do It</em>. In the years since, Judith has travelled the world consulting and conducting workshops on person-centered planning, circles of support, family support and inclusive education. Judith had a particular affinity with those who cannot speak, and she often stressed the positive impact silent people with disabilities have on the world around them.

My favourite all-time Judith quote is: “People with disabilities will only be fully included when they are so well supported that everybody wants one,” and I often think it should be our mission statement. I will miss the teacher, the leader, the visionary, the artist, and the thinker, but most of all I will miss my friend. We have suffered a great loss.

Judith’s funeral will take place on Saturday, June 6th at 1:30 pm at Metropolitan United Church, 56 Queen Street East in Toronto. A day of remembrance will be announced at a later date.

Judith is predeceased by her father Edwin (Ted) and mother Rita Snow. She leaves behind her brothers Ian (Maude), and James, and her sister Rosemary (Armand) Malo; her nephews Aidan, Owen and Stephen, her nieces Alison (Colin) Cathro and Stephanie (Ralph) Fitzgerald, and their children Annie and Hunter Fitzgerald.

				<title>Victims of Institutionalization Still Waiting for Compensation</title>
		<link>http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/?p=258</link>
		<pubDate>Fri, 12 Jun 2015 16:28:19 +0000</pubDate>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The wait isn’t over for more than 3,500 former residents of Ontario’s three large institutions, many of whom suffered abuse at the hands of staff, as the wait for legally-agreed-upon compensation drags on. According to the website of Koskie Minsky LLP, the law firm handling the settlement, these victims, who have cerebral palsy, Down Syndrome, and other intellectual disabilities, suffered “…psychological trauma, pain and suffering, loss of enjoyment of life, and exacerbation of existing mental disabilities.” Charges included choking, kicking, sexual assault, neglect, and even controlling residents with cattle prods.

The December 2013 settlement promised the victims compensation of up to $42,000, depending on the severity of their claim.  They have yet to receive any payment.

That’s because Crawford Class Action Services, which is administering the payouts, will not give out any money until they have comprehensively assessed each of the 3,568 claims. Crawford estimates that eligible class members will receive their payments by the end of the summer, but notes that this timeframe is subject to change. Even those with relatively simplistic claims have to wait until the other 3,567 have been processed. Some of the more complex individual applications are over 2,000 pages long.

[caption id="attachment_259" align="alignleft" width="300"]<a href="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/li-huronia.jpg"><img class="wp-image-259 size-medium" src="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/li-huronia-300x168.jpg" alt="li-huronia" width="300" height="168" /></a> Huronia Regional Centre[/caption]

In an interview with Update Friday for this article, Marilyn Dolmage, Litigation Guardian to one of the lead plaintiffs, Marie Slark, was not impressed. “We have not understood the delays. Many things weren’t decided until April this year, when the settlement was a year-and-a-half earlier.” While she understands the need to make sure things are done properly, Dolmage is frustrated that many of the things that are holding the process up should have been done before the settlement was reached, and that the goalposts keep being moved back. “We don’t object to doing it right. We just don’t understand why so much had to be dealt with after the settlement was in place. We think the delays are because the settlement was poorly worded.”  For its part, Koskie Minsky's website advises that payments may be ready by the end of the summer, again with the proviso that this is subject to change.

In addition to the long wait times, recipients are frustrated at their lack of options. Crawford will not issue previews of the amount claimants can expect to receive, and they cannot appeal the final amount. Only those who have been disallowed entirely can take advantage of a 30-day appeal window. The only relief is that payments will not be subject to taxes or claw backs, or affect disability, welfare, or unemployment benefits.

Allegations of abuse at the Southwestern, Rideau, and Huronia regional centres date back decades, with evidence showing that staff worked together to cover it up. In 1977, summer student Carol Higgins wrote a tearful letter to Huronia administration, saying “I think it’s good that staff [s]tand up for each other and stick together. However at H.R.C., it seems to be the wrong kind of loyalty. It is loyalty that says ‘I won’t report you for beating up that resident if you don’t report me for beating up this one.’” Another employee who reported abuse, Patricia Pandke, stated in 1989 that the only reason she hadn’t said anything sooner was that she “…[had] a genuine fear of what these people might do to my family and myself in the event that one or all chose to seek revenge.” Even as recently as 2000, a Ministry of Community and Social Services Review Report said that staff preferred to remain anonymous when discussing mistreatment problems due to fear of reprisals from coworkers. Expert evidence in 2013 showed that such abuse, and silence on the part of the staff, continued well into the 2000s.

Slark, who, along with her brother and sister, spent many years at Huronia, was forcibly silenced any time she spoke up and refused to do work at the facility, telling Update Friday “They shut me up by putting me on medication. About three years, three different kinds of medications.” All three institutions were shuttered by 2009.

That is just the tip of the proverbial iceberg when it comes to how victims were treated.  Dolmage, who used to be a social worker at Huronia, and has been investigating this case for 47 years, described men who were sexually abused every night. A 75-year-old gentleman who used to live there “…still sleeps in his clothes in his closet because of what happened to him. He’s had his feet stomped on, he can’t wear proper shoes, his hands are injured so badly from being beaten…There are many people living in Community Living group homes who never got over this.”

When Slark was transferred from the facility to a Huronia foster home, the conditions were terrible, but she didn’t tell Marilyn (who was her social worker at the time) for fear of being made to return to the even worse institution.<!--more-->

Children as young as 10 or 11 years old, referred to as ‘ward workers’, were forced to look after others with greater disabilities. They had no training, which often led to disastrous results. According to Dolmage, former residents recalling such childhood experiences say things like, “I didn’t know how to look after these people. I was just a kid myself. I fed him…he choked, and the next day, they weren’t there. And now I realize they died, and I think what I did killed them.”

The poor treatment of many former residents has led to concerns that the compensation levels may not be adequate. Dolmage thinks this way, saying “We did all this work, and the money is not going to the people who should be getting it…The most people can get is $42,000. And this is for being raped every night of your life.”

One of the positive outcomes of the case is that family members have been allowed access to their loved ones’ patient files. According to the file for Ms Slark’s brother, Tommy, his hip got fractured so badly one day at Huronia that it needed reconstruction with plates, and he simultaneously hit his head hard enough to cause him regular Grand Mal seizures ever since. Tommy’s file claims that the incident was an accident on his part. The family finds this suspicious, however, as a random fall would be unlikely to cause that kind of damage to a man

[caption id="attachment_260" align="alignright" width="300"]<a href="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/7161751-SouthwesternRegional-Centre-original.jpg"><img class="wp-image-260 size-medium" src="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/7161751-SouthwesternRegional-Centre-original-300x200.jpg" alt="Southwestern Regional Centre" width="300" height="200" /></a> Southwestern Regional Centre[/caption]

who was only 17 at the time. They also point to the fact that it was his left hip that got fractured, but the right side of his forehead.  There was also evidence of sexual activity on Tommy’s part—claims reviewers may argue that it  was consensual, even though he has not engaged in any such activities since leaving the institution. For claimants who can speak for themselves, no supporting documentation is needed to back up their claims—in fact, the only way they can be denied is if the government specifically finds a file that says, for instance, ‘This man was not raped.’ However, it works the opposite way for people who can’t speak. The key point is that the person must be able to <em>say</em> they were abused in these ways. Since Tommy does not speak, and since his file, which was written by staff, doesn’t directly say he <em>was</em> assaulted, he may get the minimum compensation of just $2,000. Dolmage says that any settlement money not distributed to claimants will be returned to the government, and that Koskie Minsky pocketed fees of $6 million from the three cases, with an additional $8 million in profits.

This huge profit does not seem to have translated into huge respect for the firm’s clients. Slark bemoans the fact that even their legal team at Koskie Minsky may not have the best interests of her and her fellow claimants at heart. She says the reason they settled instead of going to trial was that Koskie Minsky assured them this method would get them paid much sooner. “The lawyer said to us, ‘How would you like to have your money this fall,’ and we said, ‘That would be nice,’ but we didn’t get our money in 2013 [or 2014].”

This brings to light an issue with the settlement that is particular to this case—that disability-related accommodations should have been written into the agreement. Estate executors of people who die before receiving their compensation—and there have been many, according to Dolmage—are entitled to claim for them. However, many of these people don’t have wills, and some, due to the specific nature of their challenges, legally cannot. On top of this, Slark (again, one of the lead plaintiffs) did not understand the settlement she was forced to agree to. Koskie Minsky was the only party that was required to sign.  This firm is currently representing complainants in 16 similar class-action suits.

[caption id="attachment_262" align="alignleft" width="300"]<a href="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/RRC_Smiths-Falls.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-262" src="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/RRC_Smiths-Falls-300x200.jpg" alt="Rideau Regional Centre" width="300" height="200" /></a> Rideau Regional Centre[/caption]

Since reaching the settlement, Slark and fellow lead plaintiff Patricia Seth (whose Litigation Guardian is Dolmage's husband, Jim) have become champions for equal treatment of people with disabilities. Last week, they were awarded the Tanis Doe Award for Canadian Disability Studies and Culture (English Language) for their dedication to this case.  The ceremony took place at the Canadian Disability Studies Association conference held by the Congress of the Federation of the Humanities and Social Sciences. They were the first people outside of professors and PhD students to win this award. Marie has also started an initiative to tell her story visually through fabric art, her creation of which was looked down upon when she started learning it at Huronia.

In addition to the payouts, the settlement also called for a public apology from the premier and the placement of over 60,000 documents into the public record. While Premiere Kathleen Wynne’s apology was initially appreciated, Slark finds her promises of repentance empty considering the ambiguous wait times, small expected payout, and the fact that the settlement only covers abuse—not neglect. A marked cemetery at the Huronia site will honour the 2,000 people who died at the institution over the years. Most had previously been in unmarked graves.

While the graveyard will be appreciated by survivors and their families as both a memorial and a symbol, it’s also a stark reminder of what’s at stake. As more and more time passes, survivors are less and less likely to be able to take advantage of what little compensation they are deemed eligible for. “We’re really concerned,” Dolmage stated, cutting through the semantics and getting to the heart of the matter, “because these are elderly, vulnerable, fragile people—many of them—and more and more of them are dying.”

				<title>Ontario Falling Short on Accessibility Goals</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Ten years ago this week, Ontario's 1.8 million people with disabilities won a huge victory. After years of tireless grassroots advocacy, we convinced Queen's Park to unanimously pass a landmark law requiring the government to lead Ontario to become fully accessible by 2025.

It gave 20 years to tear down the many barriers blocking Ontarians with disabilities from fully participating in jobs, schools, transit, public services, restaurants and stores. Ontarians with physical, mental or sensory disabilities faced physical barriers (such as steps to enter a school), technological barriers (such as websites lacking simple features to make them compatible with adapted computers for blind and dyslexic people); and bureaucratic barriers (such as municipal officials ordering a restaurant to rip out its front door's accessibility ramp).

The Wynne government has organized parties to celebrate this law's 10th anniversary, calling itself a world leader on disability accessibility. But how are we really doing?

The government got off to a good start in the first years after this promising law was passed. We've made more progress than would have been the case without it.

However, Brad Duguid, the minister responsible for the implementation of the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act, rightly conceded last week that government efforts flagged in recent years. A government-appointed independent review reported last year that after a decade, this law hasn't made nearly the promised impact on Ontarians with disabilities. Its report showed that we are not on schedule for full accessibility by 2025.

Ontario has fallen short on several fronts.<!--more-->

As former lieutenant governor David Onley has declared, massive disability unemployment isn't just a national crisis. It's a national shame.

Many if not most public buildings remain physically inaccessible. Blind people with guide dogs are still too often denied access to restaurants or taxis. In 2010 the government launched its new Presto smart card for paying public transit, replete with accessibility problems.

Ontario's public service claims to lead by example on accessibility. Too often it leads by the wrong example, as it did in 2011 when it wrongly tried to abolish a legally mandatory fund that finances workplace accommodations for Ontario public servants with disabilities.

The government failed to act on our repeated urging to get more tourism and hospitality providers to become more accessible for the 2015 Pan/Parapan Am Games. Of a billion potential tourists with disabilities worldwide, many will be watching to see if we're an accessible destination worth a future visit. When you see that torch crossing Ontario, imagine the trail of increased tourism accessibility it could have blazed, had the government listened to us.

Why are we doing so poorly? Ontario hasn't created all the accessibility standards needed to ensure the province reaches full accessibility by 2025. Nor has it effectively enforced the accessibility standards we have. The government knows of years of rampant private-sector violations of this law. Yet it too often sat on its hands, leaving unspent millions of dollars dedicated to the act's implementation.

Still, there is hope. Queen's Park announced some helpful new measures last week (though not enough to ensure full accessibility by 2025). There remains enough time to reach our goal, if the government goes substantially further.

We need Premier Kathleen Wynne to keep her pledge to direct all ministers to fulfil all unkept government accessibility promises. We need new accessibility standards created; for example, one to tear down barriers in our education system that contribute to massive disability unemployment. The revitalized leadership on accessibility that last year's independent review urged Wynne to show could build on her government's first steps announced last week.

Our non-partisan grassroots accessibility movement is more determined than ever, now energized with powerful social media. People who see accessibility barriers to stores, restaurants, tourism sites, or transit during the 2015 Games, can video them and broadcast them online. The hashtag "#accessibility" reaches a huge audience.

Inaccessibility for us is or will be inaccessibility for you. If you don't have a disability now, you'll almost certainly get one as you age.

A majority of MPPs who voted for the Disabilities Act in 2005 and their staff have since left Queen's Park. We aim to get their replacements as fired up about this issue as were their predecessors.

An impossible uphill challenge? We're used to it. We live those every day. Grassroots tenacity won this law in 2005. It can work again.

				<title>Working Together to Support Seniors with Intellectual Disabilities</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A coordinated effort to better serve seniors who have an intellectual disability requiring health and long-term care has taken root in Haldimand and Norfolk counties.

Community Living Access Support Services, Community Living Haldimand and Norfolk Association for Community Living, along with other stakeholders, have created a training curriculum on research-based best practices in the assessment, treatment and support of seniors with intellectual disabilities.

The three-year initiative began with a $50,000 grant from the Ontario Trillium Foundation and a commitment from the Seniors Partnership Group, regional service providers dedicated to working together more closely.

The group has been meeting monthly since 2006, identifying common interests in supporting seniors with intellectual disabilities. In addition to the Community Living associations, the group is also comprised of the Alzheimer’s Society, Mental Health, CCAC, Support Services, and long-term care facilities.
<a href="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Fotolia_62966138_Subscription_Monthly_M.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-277" src="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Fotolia_62966138_Subscription_Monthly_M-300x200.jpg" alt="Old woman" width="300" height="200" /></a>Learning breakfasts were held to enable the organizations to better understand each other’s service offerings. Some of their initial activities centered on promoting aging awareness among families, RDSP and estate planning, and health promotion.

“It just evolved into how do we help our own agencies and those at the table from a service delivery standpoint to be prepared to support these individuals as they age,” says Susan Wavell, Executive Director of Community Living Haldimand.

The Seniors Partnership Group also undertook a community study looking at the demographics of the service agencies’ populations. The study found that over half of the people receiving services were over the age of 45. It also determined that specialized service staff for seniors is often untrained, leading to less effective care and treatment.

“That was a clear indication that we needed to look at what our long-term supports were going to be,” said Wavell.

What came out of those discussions was the idea to develop a training curriculum that could be utilized by developmental service and health-related agencies in their communities. In exchange for the curriculum, training and support network, all participating agencies agreed to prioritize internal training of their staff on the topic of aging and intellectual disabilities.

“One of the things we found was that, other than some information through the Alzheimer’s Society, which has been great in training our staff around dementia issues and related topics, there wasn’t anything coordinated and specific to people aging and developmental disabilities,” said Patricia Morris, Executive Director of Community Living Access Support Services.

“At least in our area, we couldn’t seem to find anything, so we started to build a curriculum ourselves.”

Work on the training curriculum began in October 2013, shortly after receiving funding for the project. It took a year to develop with the assistance of consultants and a train-the-trainer model in mind. The curriculum consists of multiple components and enables organizations to access them when needed. It also teaches frontline staff about the information required by health care providers.<!--more-->

Currently, more than two dozen representatives from the various service providers have received instruction on the curriculum, and they are now training frontline staff within their own organizations.

“I think it’s a really significant issue for our services because as people are aging, our response and our resources need to be reallocated differently within our service system,” said Stella Barker, Executive Director of the Norfolk Association for Community Living.

“If we have people within our own organizations who are really knowledgeable about the curriculum and are able to train other staff, I think that will help us be more flexible in responding to the needs of people as they age.”

The Seniors Partnership Group is in discussions to make the training curriculum available to others across the province.

Morris, Wavell and Barker will be discussing the relationships they have developed and the training curriculum project as part of their presentation, <em>Developing Regional Capacity: Aging and Developmental Disabilities - A Training of Trainers</em>, at Community Living Ontario’s 62<sup>nd</sup> Annual Conference and AGM.

				<title>How to Live, Not Just Survive, With an Intellectual Disability</title>
		<link>http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/?p=279</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="color: #222222;">There is a clear difference between helping a person with an intellectual disability to stay alive and helping them to live. That mindset has driven the career of Michael Kendrick, a sought-after writer, public speaker, service evaluator, and consultant on the topic of helping people to live meaningful lives. “The overall process is really one of imagining ‘better…’” he says, “you can always have a lifestyle, but is it a lifestyle that’s really personally fulfilling?”</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Kendrick, who has been part of Canada’s community living movement, at all levels of government, since the 1970’s, thinks a large barrier to having people live good lives is the amount of time spent on ‘custodial’ work, rather than working to help them reach their full potential. He believes that, even though many resources are dedicated to assisting people with intellectual disabilities, support workers aren’t sure how to best use those resources, so they fall back into mostly housekeeping-style roles. “There’s nothing wrong with going for coffee [with someone with an intellectual disability], but it’s not what you’d call a lifestyle development breakthrough.”</p>
<p style="color: #222222;"><a href="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/drmkendrick.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-281" src="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/drmkendrick-300x170.jpg" alt="drmkendrick" width="300" height="170" /></a>In other words, many of these people need those who support them to think outside the box. They are often stuck in what Kendrick terms ‘the tyranny of routine.’ They don’t know how to do more. “A frequent complaint of people with disabilities is just how bored they are with their lives…The person with the disability is often a hostage to the control and influence of others, so you really want to create a condition where the person can be much more directing of their own life, and a force in their own life…” Kendrick points out. Engaging the supported person in things they enjoy and excel at can increase their quality-of-life.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Two obstacles that Kendrick deems noteworthy are the challenge of opening the person’s mind and communicating with them and the importance of continuity of support. How can support workers and families help create more satisfying lives? “I think it begins, first of all,” he offers, “with trying to understand the person, rather than trying to fit them with some kind of program.” In other words, one size does not fit all, and efforts to find them careers and opportunities to participate in the community should be flexible, adapting to their particular interests and needs.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Of course, understanding what these passions are can be difficult with some people with intellectual disabilities. Some have difficulty saying what they really mean, while others can’t speak at all. For the former, Kendrick stresses the importance of really getting to know them, which will help family members or support workers read between the lines. When the person does not speak, he says that it’s essential to keep an eye on their conduct and reactions.<!--more--></p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Another barrier in creating good lives for people relates to how staff members come and go out of a supported person’s life so often that progress becomes slow. In Ontario, many people get one planning session a year, and the people implementing the plan may be different from those who made it. Kendrick spoke to this, saying that, in such situations, “…there’s no continuity of effort, and so you’re not really building very much, because everybody comes in and goes back to square one.”</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">He points to the bureaucracy many community agencies force. Since people ‘tag out’ so often, “There’s no capacity to take the plan and have people build on it and follow through on it. If you did have that, you’d have much more chance of breaking new ground.”</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">As these big life changes cannot be immediate, and since agency staff are often only involved for a short time, Kendrick extols the value of communities in helping someone with an intellectual disability to reach their potential. Unlike organizations, members of someone’s community (or ‘circle’) can be involved in their lives for much longer. Friends and family, with help from the person with an intellectual disability themselves, can create a flexible plan that changes as needed, rather than being addressed at a once-a-year meeting. “They don’t need the permission of the system to go ahead and get a life,” he suggests. “They just go do it.”</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Agencies often have trouble being so adaptable since, in addition to not meeting as frequently, employees must divide their loyalties between the person they support and the organization they work for. Community members have no such conflicting interests. However, cautions Kendrick, this is not to say that agencies have no place at the table, as “…the role of services is to come to the party, but not to dictate what the party is.”</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">One of the strongest ways to inspire people, though, is to simply expose them to others who have come from a similar situation and succeeded. Kendrick gave the example of a hypothetical man who gets a paid job after being unemployed for 25 years. He would serve as inspiration for someone else currently going through such a trying time. “Even the example that you can direct your own life can be quite inspiring,” Kendrick states, in closing. “People need positive reinforcement that this isn’t a fool’s errand—that you actually can do this.”</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">- <strong>Daniel Share-Strom</strong></p>]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Mr Kendrick has given a good description of the situation people under care face.
Agencies must loosen up the concern about LIABILITY and either hire independent facilitators to build networks of support around the person and train the staff to help with the network, by making more connections with the community. All people under care or living with their families benefit from building relationships with the people they like. Parents benefit from lifetime networks of support for their son or daughter living at home or under care, so when they are not there the network will make sure the person is having a good life and not just living with food and shelter.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Hello, everyone! My name is Daniel Share-Strom, and I’m working with Community Living Ontario’s Communications team this summer as their Assistant Coordinator of Communications and Marketing. I have a BA in Communications from the University of Ontario Institute of Technology, and I’m a member of the population that benefits from the services of organizations like Community Living. Understand, though, that these are not the reasons I’m here; I am here because I love telling stories.

A quick Googling of my name will show you the story I’m most well-known for telling—my own. As a motivational speaker with Asperger’s Syndrome, I speak throughout Ontario to <a href="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/danielsharestrom.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-286" src="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/danielsharestrom-300x177.jpg" alt="danielsharestrom" width="300" height="177" /></a>parents, schools, teachers, and doctors on the trials that I’ve been through in life and help them to better understand and support people with Autism. This self-advocacy process has helped me to be more confident in myself, and I hope to inspire others in similar situations to do the same.

I also enjoy telling other people’s stories. From my role as Managing Editor of my university’s academic journal, The Circle@UOIT, to my time as a video game critic at VGChartz.com, and all the way down to my passion for writing film scripts and short stories, I revel in getting to a tale’s emotional truth. The lesson that has most stuck with me from my time at UOIT is that the facts of a story are not what we remember most. When we watch a movie or read a book, we remember the fears and joys we experienced alongside the characters more than specific lines of dialogue. In journalism, we remember the fresh understanding the article gave us about the world more than we do any discrete fact. What we find most memorable, in any story, is how the facts and events make us feel. I’m going to bring that philosophy to the content I contribute to Update Friday and Community Living Ontario’s website. Apologies in advance for any shed tears!

There’s one more kind of story I want to tell, but I’ll need your help. We are hungry for success stories from our friends at Community Living associations across the province. Do you support an individual who’s just landed a great job? Have you recently secured a strong partnership that you think will benefit people? We want to know. I want to know. So, shoot me an e-mail at <a href="http://mailto:dsharestrom@communitylivingontario.ca"><strong>dsharestrom@communitylivingontario.ca</strong></a>. We’ll have a chat, with virtual tea and crumpets, and I’ll help to tell your story.

Thanks for reading,

				<title>Inclusion in Education—A Student’s Perspective</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We talk a lot about inclusion at Update Friday. And why not? Successful community integration and belonging is the dream for many people with intellectual disabilities. Who doesn’t want to find a social group they really belong to? Or meaningful work? Or to move into a home of their own? One sector that has far-reaching implications on all of these areas of life, and more, is post-secondary education. The right university or college program can make a world of difference for such a person, opening up both career and social opportunities.

Or not.

While often well-intentioned, some schools are ill-equipped to negotiate the unique needs of every individual that comes their way. Improperly-handled special education support can cause major problems—lower grades, frustration, heartache, and a loss of self-esteem that is often already fairly low. It is important to get to know the specific issues a person brings to the table and to create a plan to help them succeed. Two people who can attest are Concordia University student Stephanie Boghen and yours truly, Daniel Share-Strom.

The two of us have experienced firsthand, in different ways, the effects that individualized methods of teaching can have on people with varying learning needs. Boghen, 37, has Down Syndrome, and has been studying at Concordia since 2012. When she first came to the school, she was overwhelmed. In a video put together by Mariella Castillo, a Concordia Human Relations student, Boghen says that, when she “...first came here, I was totally lost. In a big school like this, you don’t know what’s going to happen to you.”

That’s a sentiment that I, a person with Asperger’s Syndrome, can understand. Going to university for the first time is daunting for anybody, but when you factor in challenges like unprecedented organizational requirements and discomfort in new social situations, it has the potential to be a nightmare. Finding ways to adapt the learning process to the needs of the person plays a big role in helping them to shine.

Boghen and Castillo see this need, too, and have worked to make the process easier for people with Down Syndrome. In her paper on the subject, titled “Stages of Learning <a href="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Inclusion-Wordie.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-294 size-medium" src="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Inclusion-Wordie-300x185.jpg" alt="Inclusion Wordie" width="300" height="185" /></a>Development for Adults with Down Syndrome When Pursuing Higher Education,” Castillo describes the areas that an inclusive education can improve for someone with Down Syndrome, though it really applies to any intellectual disability. It allows access to “…The richness of real life experience…authentic problem solving opportunities…a wider curriculum…a naturally increased social network…[and] developing a wide range of vocabulary and background knowledge.” For the past three years, they have been developing a Reciprocal Learning method that plays to the abilities of people with Down Syndrome.

“This method,” Castillo writes, “highlights that each person possess [sic] a unique way of recording and processing information regardless of his or her intellectual disability.”  She highlights that people learn through a model of ‘Input, Process, and Output.’ This means that we gather information by asking ourselves questions, take action to receive a certain end, and then create a program which “…meets the participant’s standards and hopefully achieves their goals.” The project is adaptable, designed around creating individualized Action Plans depending on the needs of the person. Through a series of interviews and self-assessment assignments filled out by the individual and their parents, and gathering various pieces of data, facilitators discover how to best work with each person in order to maximize their potential and create a safe, non-judgmental environment.

This approach has allowed Boghen to thrive, saying, “Nothing stops me when I have a disability. I have dreams—I have all kinds of things. I would encourage other people with disabilities to be here, as well.”

If only my own university experience had been so accommodating. Make no mistake—I made lasting friendships with both fellow students and professors during my time in the University of Ontario’s Communications program, and I received high honours for my academic prowess. Those achievements came, however, largely in <em>spite</em> of my dealings with the school’s Special Education Department. My Individual Education Plan noted difficulties with organization and time management, and yet every time I wanted extra time on a test, the process was this:
<ol>
	<li>Obtain a request form from the Special Education Department.</li>
	<li>Fill out the same accommodation requirements you’ve filled out for your entire post-secondary career.</li>
	<li>Deliver one copy to the testing centre.</li>
	<li>Deliver another copy to the professor administering the test.</li>
	<li>Do all of this at least one week in advance.</li>
</ol>
Having to do this with every test for six years (I was in the Video Game Development program for the first two) was the cause of many meltdowns over the years.

<!--more-->

Support staff were quite inflexible when a problem arose, as well. In order to combat the isolation a person like myself often feels in such situations, my mother and I requested their help in forming a social group for people on the Autism spectrum at the school. We received a blunt, “We don’t do that.” Do what? Be creative? Help people who are struggling? My IEP also allowed for me to be excused from tests or exams—to be retaken at a later date—should I suffer an anxiety attack while writing. Yet, the one time this occurred, I had to wait half an hour until my support worker arrived, took me for a brief walk, and returned me to my station. It was a subject I knew inside out, yet because I couldn’t think clearly enough at the time to remind them of my legal documentation, I nearly failed the final exam.

This is not a pity party, though—through help from family, friends, and a few understanding professors, I graduated with Distinction and forged lifelong relationships. The point is, a great deal of aggravation and misery could have been spared if the school had been able to flexibly adapt to the needs of each person with an intellectual disability.

We have the potential to thrive in school when the right supports are in place, moving into meaningful careers and meeting people who will be important to us. Just ask Boghen, who concludes “We were always followers. We were never leaders. But then, as time goes on, even though I’m a follower, I feel like I’m also part leader, as well. There are so many things that are beneficial, being in the surroundings of university life. I am doing it, and I hope others will follow in my footsteps.”

				<title>Community Living Atikokan Serves Up Opportunities</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="color: #000000;">When Brandon Bain graduated from high school in a small town in rural Manitoba, he had very few options. There were little to no job prospects, and he didn’t want to live in Winnipeg because he would have felt unsafe.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">So Brandon moved to Atikokan to be closer to family. The small Northwestern Ontario community is home to 2,400 people and is located two hours west of Thunder Bay. Mining and forestry are the community’s leading economic drivers. Quetico Provincial Park is nearby, and the town is also home to <strong><a style="color: #0074c8;" href="http://eblast.gotenzing.com/t/r-l-ahitljy-l-n/" target="_blank">Community Living Atikokan</a>.</strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">With some encouragement from his mother when he relocated in 2006, Brandon met with Community Living Atikokan’s Executive Director at the time to see whether the organization could assist him in finding work. He had a job about a month later, working at Chips ‘R’ Us, the association’s social enterprise.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“My first job I spent the summer doing food prep in the potato room. I did that for one whole summer as part of my training period,” says Bain.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“After I did that, they basically took me under their wing. They put me in different areas.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Brandon tried his hand at lawn cutting, laundry, cleaning at the local employment centre, before moving on to yard maintenance. He still works at Chips ‘R’ Us.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-299" src="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Brandon-Bain-v-2-300x239.jpg" alt="Brandon Bain v 2" width="300" height="239" />Jim Turner, Community Living Atikokan’s Executive Director, concedes finding work for people with intellectual disabilities can be difficult in a small community where jobs are limited, particularly when the economy is in a downturn.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“You have grown men that, at one time would have worked in mills or mines, now pumping gas and stocking shelves in the grocery stores. I have teenaged sons and they’re unable to find work. If the teenagers in the town are unable to find work, the people we support have a more difficult time. As a result, we’ve evolved how employment’s done through our organization,” said Turner.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The association has obtained employment contracts from many homeowners or businesses in town. As is the case with Brandon, the organization also provides employment services to the people they support.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">All 24 people supported by Community Living Atikokan have jobs, earning $11/hour or more. Half of them work at Chips ‘R’ Us.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The business is well-known to people in Atikokan and surrounding communities. Open six months a year, Chips ‘R’ Us garners a steady stream of customers. The food preparation and cooking are done by people supported by Community Living Atikokan.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“I’ve watched people do U-turns on Main Street because they’ve driven by and seen it. They weren’t thinking about grabbing an order of fries. But once they see it or smell it, they do the U-turn and do a quick stop,” says Turner.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">In addition to having ‘the best fries in Northwestern Ontario,’ as Turner attests, the social enterprise provides the organization with prominence in the area. Community Living Atikokan has also raised its profile in other ways, like celebrating inclusive businesses at the association’s barbecue in May as part of Community Living Month. They also recognize businesses in town that provide employment opportunities, either through contacts or by employing people with disabilities directly, with the Widening Our World award.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“The members make the determination and whoever [is working with that] winning business is the one that presents the WOW award at the Chamber of Commerce Awards Dinner,” says Turner.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">In addition, Community Living Atikokan awards a bursary to a local high school student that is pursuing an education in either developmental services or a related field.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The organization is also determined to change how accommodation supports are provided. Like many Community Living associations across the province, Community Living Atikokan operates a group home. The organization also acquired a small apartment building to ensure people had a decent standard of housing.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Now, after consulting with people receiving support and taking cues from the Select Committee on Developmental Service’s Interim Report, Community Living Atikokan’s Board of Directors, in consultation with families, has decided to close its group home.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“Several members living there indicated that they didn’t want to live there, they weren’t living there by choice,” says Turner.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The group home will close in the fall. The association also purchased additional homes, after individuals living in the apartment building indicated they want to live in the community. The apartment building is being renovated, so that people currently living in the group home will have their own apartment with on-site supports.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“We’re changing the support services that we provide, in order to accommodate the requests of the members,” says Turner.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“It’s helping individuals we support live their lives to the fullest, it’s real simple. Everything we do is about helping people achieve their goals and their dreams.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Earlier this year, Turner’s staff assisted Brandon with achieving a dream he’s talked about for years – getting his driver’s licence.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“All winter long, a staff memb
er was set aside to sit with me to help me get my beginners and that’s one thing I’ve obtained,” says Bain, proudly.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">He’s hoping to take a beginner driver education course in neighbouring Fort Frances or Thunder Bay, in order to get his G2.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Brandon, who has been a Member of the Council of Community Living Ontario for the past four years, appreciates the services and supports offered by Community Living Atikokan.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“They do very well at putting people on their feet that have disabilities or don’t have the courage or strength to do it on their own.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">- <strong>Ron Laroche</strong></p>]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Student Links Profile: Jay Patel, Web Designer and Metalworker Extraordinaire</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It’s never too early to start planning for the future. That’s why Jay Patel, 15, hasn’t simply learned to program through Community Living Ontario’s Student Links initiative—he’s developed a set of web development skills that he hopes will have a direct application to the family business. Update Friday spoke with Jay as part of its initiative to spotlight some of the success stories of the Student Links program.

“That was a fun experience,” Putin told Update Friday, referring to the opportunity he had to work with Rohit Prasad, his mentor and a recent graduate in Software Engineering and Industrial Design.

Together, the two built a mock website for his father’s metalwork company, Mental Manufacturing. Jay enjoyed “Having to put a lot of pictures, descriptions for what each thing does.” The best part was, though, that the mock-up was not just an exercise—if all goes well his father, Ketan, plans to actually use the website to help conduct business.

[caption id="attachment_303" align="alignleft" width="290"]<a href="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Jay-and-Rohit.jpg"><img class="wp-image-303 size-medium" src="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Jay-and-Rohit-290x300.jpg" alt="" width="290" height="300" /></a> Jay and Rohit[/caption]

Jay’s excitement for learning was apparently evident from the get-go. “Meeting Jay was really exciting because he reminded me of myself when I was in high school,” said Rohit in an e-mail. “Loves technology, super eager to learn and willing to try new things. So when we first met we decided it would be a good idea to learn how to create a simple website. I’d walk him through it and he could keep exploring the possibilities on his own later.”

Jay seems to be doing just that. Not only is he developing the site for Mental Manufacturing—he hopes to take over the company himself one day.

He’s trained for that potential eventuality, having helped out with work over the years. “I’ve seen a lot of physical metal work, and I figured I felt strong enough to be able to take over that stuff...” he boasted. “I’ve known how to use a lot of machines back in the day. I use the welding machine, I use the bending [machine], I use the punching machine, pretty much everything.”

Rohit gained something from the program, as well. “I learned a lot, not only from Jay but from the volunteer experience itself. It was great being exposed to Jay’s eagerness to learn, but also at the same time, it felt great to impart knowledge, to be able to teach something you’re passionate about, and working with someone equally passionate about it.”

The two aren’t together anymore, as Rohit has since taken a job in Germany, but he has nothing but good feelings toward his former student. “We’re gonna keep in touch and I like to think he’s learned as much from me as I did from the whole experience!”

All of this has given Jay what he believes is a strong direction to focus on as he completes high school, saying “I’d like to start taking these IT courses, business, stuff like that.”

In addition to taking over the family business, he’s considering opening his own IT company on the side, which may potentially serve Mental Manufacturing as a client.

“Through the experience,” his Student Links coordinator, Natalie Lowe, provided, “Jay was able to think about how his potential role as a business owner/manager and his interest in computers can be combined together to establish a lasting progressive business.”

Planning for the future, indeed!

				<title>Interest High for New Housing Options</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="color: #000000;">Members of the <a style="color: #0074c8;" href="http://eblast.gotenzing.com/t/r-l-akijjkk-l-x/" target="_blank"><strong>Developmental Services Housing Task Force </strong></a>met last month to complete their deliberations regarding proposals for creative and sustainable solutions to the housing crisis in the Developmental Services Sector.  Currently, there are approximately 14,000 adults with intellectual disabilities in need of residential supports.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">80 proposals were submitted as part of the first round of the Expression of Interest (EOI) process. For the last six weeks, the Task Force has been reviewing the proposals to determine which ones should be passed on to the <a style="color: #0074c8;" href="http://eblast.gotenzing.com/t/r-l-akijjkk-l-m/" target="_blank"><strong>Ministry of Community and Social Services </strong></a>(MCSS) for final approval.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Update Friday spoke with <strong>Ron Pruessen</strong>, Chair of the Housing Task Force, about the review process. “We were overwhelmed with the amount of great ideas and projects that were submitted. It was almost frustrating because we knew that with our limited funding, we wouldn’t be able to consider all of them,” says Pruessen.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">With an annual budget of $3 million, the Task Force hopes to provide funding to the projects that prove to be effective responses to tackling the current waitlist of people who require residential services.<a href="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/fair-housing-month.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-321 size-medium" src="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/fair-housing-month-300x160.jpg" alt="fair-housing-month" width="300" height="160" /></a></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The proposals that were selected by the Task Force have been referred to MCSS with the expectation that several of the proposals will be approved for future funding.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The Housing Task Force has a second EOI planned for the fall and will be accepting new proposals.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“Our plan is to set a deadline for the second round of proposals for the fall in order to fully utilize the funding provided for this fiscal year,” says Pruessen.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“In this particular EOI process, we were focusing on sustainable, creative ideas that could help leverage the funding from MCSS for housing supports and residential programs. We did not want to look at things that were already being done.”<!--more--></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">In addition to the funding, the two tiered proposal process was developed so that the Housing Task Force could grant people and organizations enough time to fine tune their submissions and to ensure that all of their creative ideas were taken into consideration.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">In the future, the Housing Task Force is looking to access the expertise, experience and the resources of other ministries, in particular the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing and the Ministry of Health. Pruessen believes that there is an underlying assumption that MCSS solely carries the burden of handling residential supports, when in fact there should be several other ministries involved with solving the housing crisis.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“Starting in September, there will be a very intensive push on how government efforts address these housing issues.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Another key objective for the Housing Task Force is to secure for more funding from the government. With the amount of proposals and ideas that are being submitted, Pruessen believes more funding will give the Housing Task Force the ability to make more of the ideas and proposals a reality.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">If you or someone you know is interested in submitting an Expression of Interest in the fall, visit the Housing Task Force website <a style="color: #0074c8;" href="http://eblast.gotenzing.com/t/r-l-akijjkk-l-f/" target="_blank"><strong>here</strong></a> for more information.</p>]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Broadcasting Inclusion: Connect 4 Life to Run First Radio Training Program for People with Disabilities</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #0074c8;" href="http://eblast.gotenzing.com/t/r-l-akijjkk-l-jt/" target="_blank"><strong>Connect 4 Life</strong></a> is making sure people with disabilities are heard with its new <a style="color: #0074c8;" href="http://eblast.gotenzing.com/t/r-l-akijjkk-l-ji/" target="_blank"><strong>An Accessible Voice</strong></a> in Broadcasting program. The 24-week class is the first of its kind designed for people with disabilities, and will be held in the fall at the <a style="color: #0074c8;" href="http://eblast.gotenzing.com/t/r-l-akijjkk-l-jd/" target="_blank"><strong>Broadcast Training Centre (BTC)</strong></a> in Mississauga.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The program is designed to immerse students in the world of radio broadcasting, giving them an intensive course in hosting and interviewing, production, advertising, and related fields. “It’s an introduction to everything to see what areas you really enjoy and where your strengths are,” said Melanie Taddeo, Founder and President of Connect 4 Life.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Taddeo, who is legally blind and cannot read, decided in 2014 that she wanted a way to get information out to anyone with any kind of disability. The fact that nobody sees a person who is talking on the radio was appealing to her. “I can’t see a lot of things, and so perhaps when I’m in front of other people, we don’t connect the way [others do], but behind the scenes…behind the microphone, as I say, you have an opportunity to express yourself and get your message across in a comfortable situation, because no one’s really watching you.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><a href="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/connect4life.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-325" src="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/connect4life-300x290.png" alt="connect4life" width="300" height="290" /></a>She came up with the concept for<a style="color: #0074c8;" href="http://eblast.gotenzing.com/t/r-l-akijjkk-l-jh/" target="_blank"><strong> Voices 4 Ability</strong></a>, the world’s first online radio station produced for, about, and by people with disabilities. The station runs weather, sports, news, and entertainment programs. “What’s really amazing about it,” she elaborated, “is everybody that works on our station has some sort of disability, or they’re an ally, or caregiver, advocate, or somebody that likes to work with individuals with disabilities. It’s a great way for individuals with disabilities to learn about what’s happening in their communities, but also to be able to share their messages and to tell their stories.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">However, simply operating the station presented some challenges for some people who wanted to participate. “All of our volunteers,” explains Taddeo, “some would come with no experience at all, and some would have very little self-confidence. Once they started with us, and started learning all of the different techniques of radio, they really blossomed and they’ve shown their talents and their skills.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">She said that only about 2% of individuals with disabilities are employed in the broadcasting sector, but she believes there are a lot of opportunities for people, provided they have the right tools.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">That’s where An Accessible Voice in Broadcasting comes in. As opposed to the many colleges and universities that offer radio broadcasting programs, this course is designed to accommodate everyone, regardless of their ability. There is a teacher (with over 30 years’ experience in the industry) for every five students, meaning each person can get the attention they require. Every person’s specific disability will be accommodated; people in wheelchairs will have accessible workstations, the visually-impaired will have appropriate computer software, and those with intellectual delays will have the work presented to them in a manner that they understand.<!--more--></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Each week brings a new project, from writing skills to finding out what is going on in the city that people may want to know about. As the program continues, students get the chance to interview people and host shows. “We want our clients and students to be prepared if they got a job anywhere,” said Taddeo, “to be able to do anything from the weather, sports, the news, to hosting an actual show, right down to the final project where they put everything from the commercial, the interview, the whole show together themselves, which is really exciting.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">These projects, once completed, will be aired on Voices 4 Ability, as well as Connect 4 Life’s other stations - 4 Corners Radio and thehazefm. Students can also use the projects in portfolios to get into postsecondary programs or the workforce. Perhaps the biggest prize, though, is that participants receive a volunteer internship position at a larger radio station following the program’s completion.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Classes start September 8th, running Monday through Friday, and are available at 9am-12pm or 1pm-4pm timeslots. The fee is $20/hour, totalling $7,200 for the entire six-month period. Taddeo acknowledges that such a price may be a barrier for some, but notes that they provide resources that can help with funding.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“What you’re walking away with, and the education you’re going to be getting, it actually works out to be very cost-effective. We help our clients navigate the funding process, because we know it is difficult. We provide a funding resource board to help them find out where there are funds available for them to use to pay for our program.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Besides the fees, the only other requirement is an intake interview, where Taddeo determines if the individual is able to cognitively understand the content of the course.  “Because it is a very intense course, we want to make sure we’re setting everybody up for success.”</p>

				<title>London Woman Furthers Career, Provides for Her Family Thanks to Respite Program</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="color: #000000;"><em><a href="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/terrycll.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-329" src="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/terrycll-1024x764.jpg" alt="terrycll" width="500" height="373" /></a>Editor’s note: Thank you to Community Living London for sharing Terry’s story and for inspiring possibilities!</em></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Terry’s story begins almost ten years ago when Terry and Jeff Kew welcomed two beautiful children into the world. Twins Jorja and Jesse were born three months early, and as a result would have complex medical, physical and developmental challenges.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Thus began a lifelong journey that the Kews would face with medical professionals and support workers. When the twins were just seven months old, illness took Jeff from Terry and the children’s lives.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Now a single parent, Terry would have to manage the coordination of Jorja and Jesse’s care alone. The challenges presented by meeting the needs of the twins and keeping everyone organized and on schedule kept Terry from returning to the career that she had prior to having children. Terry knew that she had to go back to school and find a career that would better fit with her new responsibilities.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">But how was she going to be able to do this? She knew that she needed help. That help would eventually come in the form of <a style="color: #0074c8;" href="http://eblast.gotenzing.com/t/r-l-akijjkk-l-k/" target="_blank"><strong>Community Living London</strong></a> (CLL), family and friends.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Terry gains strength from her children. Jorja’s bright smile complements her feisty, energetic and extremely strong-willed personality. Jorja lights up a room, making everyone smile or laugh when she suddenly bursts out with laughter. Cerebral Palsy confines Jorja to a wheelchair. Her cochlear implant enables her to hear all that is going on around her which is very important to this inquisitive little girl. Jorja enjoys attending school and is in a developmental class.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Jesse is an inquisitive, highly energetic, intelligent, caring and affectionate boy. Jesse has a feeding tube to aid with diet and digestion issues. Along with his medical needs, Jesse is diagnosed with autism and ADHD. Despite his struggles, Jesse continues to amaze everyone with his charm, cleverness and remarkable memory. He attends a regular classroom at school with the help of an educational assistant.<!--more--></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">When the twins were two years of age, Terry decided to return to school. Her goal, to be able to provide the best life for her children, could only be met by continuing her education. Terry admits it was hard work obtaining a college education in Medical Office Administration, but it was worth every bit of effort.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">One of the many challenges Terry faced was preparing for her exams. The demands of caring for the children left little time for the hours of study that were required. It was during this time that Terry learned of Community Living London’s Respite Program. This provided her with the support she needed.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">CLL’s Respite Services is short term, scheduled respite for children and adults with developmental disabilities. Community Living London has three unique homes where qualified staff members provide care to participants of all ages and needs. The Respite Program was the only program which could meet the unique needs of both Jorja and Jesse. Thus it became an important part of the Kew’s lives.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Community Living London was able to schedule respite stays around Terry’s exam schedule, so she was able to study and write her exams knowing her children were safe and sound. With the support of CLL’s respite services, Terry was able to remain in school, study before exams and graduate on the President’s Honour Roll.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Terry remains very optimistic, even when the lift on her van stops working, the furnace breaks down and the basement floods (all in the same weekend); Terry remains calm and tackles one issue at a time. Terry’s best advice to other families is to access the services that are available and to take life’s challenges one day at a time.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Now that Terry has completed school she occasionally has a little bit of “free time”. Terry and the twins were able to take part in the 2015 Night of Heroes Fashion show. She was overwhelmed with emotion when she was asked to be a hero. Participating in this event and walking the runway with her children meant so much to Terry and her family.</p>]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Community Living Thunder Bay, Guardian Angels Pilot Project Hits the Streets</title>
		<link>http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/?p=339</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Urban Angels is the name of a new pilot project that was recently launched in Thunder Bay. The project is a product of a dynamic partnership between the <a href="http://eblast.gotenzing.com/t/r-l-auytijk-iihkhyyhui-o/"><strong>Guardian Angels</strong></a>, an international non-profit that promotes anti-bullying measures and safe communities, and <strong><a href="http://eblast.gotenzing.com/t/r-l-auytijk-iihkhyyhui-b/">Community Living Thunder Bay</a></strong>.

Update Friday spoke with Ian Hodgkinson, leader of the Guardian Angels initiative in Canada, and Mike Lavoie, Manager at Community Living Thunder Bay, about how the pilot project came about.

“The pilot project was a result of the success of an anti-bullying program that started with the Guardian Angels. This initial program included the teaching of self-defence techniques, as well as teaching new tools that involved diffusion, effective communication, empowerment and self-expression,” says Hodgkinson.

A<a href="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/urban-angels.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-340 size-medium" src="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/urban-angels-300x225.jpg" alt="urban angels" width="300" height="225" /></a>s a member of the Guardian Angels organization for the last two decades, Hodgkinson believes that the Urban Angels project is about teaching young adults life skills that allow them to express themselves in a safe environment, free from negative criticism. Additionally, the initiative engages individuals in physical activity and teaches them how to work together. “Over the last 20 years, I’ve noticed that many of these students each face their own set of problems and challenges. This program helps them to form bonds with one another and to realize that they are not alone, that many others face day to day challenges,” says Hodgkinson.

Community Living Thunder Bay was approached by Hodgkinson to become involved in the project after numerous recommendations from around the community. Lavoie saw the project as a way to engage transitional-aged youth supported by Community Living Thunder Bay.<!--more--> “A lot of kids coming to our agency right now for supportive independent living resources face a multitude of challenges. This pilot project was looked at as a non-traditional method that would complement the traditional supports we provide which, in many circumstances, are not as effective.”

“We sat down with Ian who already had a concept for the project and we developed a framework that embodied the support needs of each individual.”

For him, Lavoie believes the primary focus of the program is about teaching life skills, developing relationships, helping others overcome challenges and finding common ground from the experiences in their lives.

“The project becomes an outlet for the supported individuals to express themselves and deal with their personal issues with the help of others.”

To date, the Urban Angels program has been a success. 13 individuals from Community Living Thunder Bay come together as a team at least twice a week. They are also given the opportunity for individualized coaching.

Marcy Hurlbert, a Case Manager at Community Living Thunder Bay, is amazed at the transformations she’s seen in some of the participants.

“We have six young ladies between the ages of 19 and 24 who have been working with Ian for the last six weeks. Some of the physical activities they are put through are quite challenging, but it doesn’t matter what their ability or disability is, they are working together, overcoming obstacles, building up their self-esteem, gaining confidence and becoming physically stronger in the process.”

With encouragement from the community, Urban Angels has begun to create traction in the community and solidify a framework that extends beyond the traditional supports offered by Community Living Thunder Bay. In the future, the team anticipates the Urban Angels project will become an ongoing resource in the community. - <strong>Justin dePass</strong>]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Student Links Profile: Omar Shehadeh’s in Focus</title>
		<link>http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/?p=345</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Omar Shehadeh loves taking pictures. That much is evident from the slideshow he and his mentor, Michelle Chappus, presented at Community Living Ontario’s 6th Annual COMMence Conference earlier this year, which showcased stunning lakeside sunsets, autumn forests with freshly-fallen leaves and towering cityscapes. “He has a great eye,” Chappus told Update Friday. “He’s a natural at taking pictures. He’s always taking pictures.”

“I think it’s great,” Omar said of the opportunity to go on photography outings with Chappus, whom he met through the Student Links program. “I’m enjoying the moment, every time we go out. I never get bored. It just makes me happy.”

The two met when Sherry Blanchard, Community Living Ontario’s Student Links Coordinator for the Windsor/Essex Region, asked the area’s Arts Council if they knew of anyone who would be interested in mentoring somebody with a passion for photography. Chappus, who was a Windsor Camera Club member, volunteered. Since she was a teacher before retirement and loves photography and working with youth, “It was a perfect match, and that’s how it started.”

For their first meeting, the two went to an art gallery with their cameras and Chappus says that “…we hit it off right away because we were both having such a good time taking photos.”<a href="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Omar-ACWR-002-ed.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-346" src="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Omar-ACWR-002-ed-300x225.jpg" alt="Omar ACWR 002 ed" width="300" height="225" /></a>

Omar noted that he has gained a lot of social and communication skills. His mentor agreed, saying that in addition to learning about photography, “…he’s becoming very comfortable meeting new people, he’s very comfortable trying new things. Before, he was a little bit nervous with meeting people, and maybe apprehensive about his skills, but he’s very confident now.”

The two were easily drawn on why people should get involved with the Student Links program or mentoring in general. “You’re enjoying your time with someone,” Omar said.  “It could be a friend or a sibling or anyone, and you could just take them out and do whatever you like. Any subject.”

For her part, Chappus encourages anyone thinking about the program to give it a shot, as “it turned out to be a lot of fun, and I find that because we both have the same interests that we both learn from each other photography-wise. You have nothing to lose and I think you have a lot to gain if you’re considering to do this, because you develop a relationship with somebody. It just feels good to share something that you both have a mutual interest in.”

Most tellingly, though, Chappus described what Omar has taught her in an email to Blanchard, saying “Omar has opened up my eyes to the beauty around me at times when I may have missed looking outside of the box from my own perspective.”

At Chappus’ urging, Omar has now joined the Arts Council himself and has been involved in three group shows, including one that’s currently running. He’s found his work to be profitable as well, as he’s started selling his work at the events. As for the future, Omar plans on putting his skills to further use, saying “I probably want to be a wedding photographer.” Given his skills, that would seem to be a worthy goal, indeed.

				<title>Rori is Living his Dream</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em><a href="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/rori3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-349" src="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/rori3.jpg" alt="rori3" width="600" height="381" /></a>Editor’s note: Thank you to Community Living Parry Sound for sharing Rori’s story, a wonderful example of a person’s impact on their community.</em>

Former Victory School student Rori Brownley was chosen recently to carry the torch for the spectacular 2015 Pan Am Games in Toronto because he is a champion. Rori loves two things in life, sports and helping children at school, and he is great at both.

Rori is living his dream. He actively participates in competitive sporting events from bowling to snowshoeing and he coaches his own teams. Since finishing his high school studies Rori has volunteered at Victory School for the full school day from Monday to Friday. I spoke with teachers at the school who told me Rori is a huge help to them organizing gym equipment, teams, supporting students at chess tournaments and performing a myriad of other tasks. During class time Rori sets up keyboarding sessions in the hall and helps students, using hands-on training tools to learn to type.

<a href="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/rori2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-350" src="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/rori2-150x150.jpg" alt="rori2" width="150" height="150" /></a>Victory School is where Rori did his high school co-op placement and it is where he wants to be.  In fact, working with children is clearly his calling. Watching Rori at his job anyone can see that he is capable, responsible and great with the kids who respect and treat him as they would any other teacher in the school. Rori secured a job at Victory School this year as a Lunch Supervisor for two periods a day and is paid a competitive wage for that job.

Rori Brownley exemplifies a ‘Community First’ philosophy for full social inclusion of people with developmental disabilities into our daily lives. Parry Sound deserves to be proud of the way it has welcomed Rori, born with a developmental disability, to provide him with all the support he needs to thrive and live the life he wants to live.<!--more-->

Sheena Calibani has taught and mentored Rori since grade one and Victory School fully supports Rori to realize his goal of working with children within the school system. Principal Ursula Stinson says of Rori, “he has been an invaluable asset to the school”. Rori aspires to become an Educational Assistant but has been met with<a href="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/rori1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-351" src="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/rori1-150x150.jpg" alt="rori1" width="150" height="150" /></a> some barriers to achieving that goal. With the imminent closure of Victory School, Rori’s future with the Near North District School Board is questionable. What will remain unquestionable, however, are how valuable his contributions to the children at Victory School have been and the impact his presence has made to that school community.

Rori is a fine citizen contributing valuable lessons to elementary school children and he consistently demonstrates stellar sportsmanship in all of his sporting activities. Rori proudly carried the Pan Am Games torch and a more deserving Parry Sound citizen could not be found to represent our community. Beyond the torch bearing, Rori will continue to pioneer the way for a new generation of kids born with developmental disabilities who are being raised in a more inclusive educational and social system. With the encouragement of his mother Kirsten, who is an amazing advocate for her son, family, support workers, teachers, parents and staff from Victory School supporting his aspirations, Rori will overcome all obstacles in his way to a meaningful life with friends, co-workers and children to inspire with his positive attitude and determination.

				<title>CACL Offers Its Perspective on Controversial Assisted Suicide Legislation</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[“We’ve got a growing group of people in this situation,” said Michael Bach, Executive Vice-President of the Canadian Association for Community Living (CACL), on the topic of the Supreme Court of Canada’s recent decision regarding physician-assisted suicide, “and the biggest national conversation—the option we’re making available—is about physician assistance to kill yourself?”

<a href="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Michael-Bach-Cacl.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-364" src="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Michael-Bach-Cacl-300x237.jpg" alt="Michael Bach Cacl" width="300" height="237" /></a>On February 6<sup>th</sup>, 2015, the country’s top court decided that sections 241(b) and 14 of the Criminal Code, which make it illegal for anyone—doctors included—to assist in the death of another person, violated the constitutional rights of ‘grievously and irremediably ill’ adults.

Last week, the Harper government announced the creation of a three person panel to collect feedback on the ruling from Canadians, consisting of individuals who are professors at distinguished Canadian universities and who have experience in the areas of palliative care, disability studies, and constitutional law. The panel, which consists of Chair Harvey Max Chochinov, Catherine Frazee and Benoît Pelletier, has one year to compile a report for the Ministers of Justice and Health containing recommendations to shape the government’s response to the Supreme Court’s ruling.

In the case, Bach’s association and Community Living Ontario took the position that a total ban on assisted suicide should be upheld, and the two groups were disappointed when it was ruled otherwise. “The ban is in place,” he told Update Friday, “to protect vulnerable persons from being induced to commit suicide in times of weakness. Our argument is that anyone who is at the point where they’d want to take their own life [is] by definition, a vulnerable person.”

In clarification, he made it clear that they have great concern for people who are suffering. He pointed out, though, that in a lot of cases many of the pains and stresses for people who want to die in this way could be alleviated if our system accommodated them better. Bach said “…with medical advances, in 99.99% of cases, the physical pain can be dealt with through intervention.”  It’s not just the pain—often people want to die because they are in a situation where they feel they have no dignity. This can be rectified, Bach says, with proper palliative care. “Only 30 to 40% of the need for palliative care is being met. It’s an underfunded and underdeveloped system.”

People also choose assisted suicide because they feel they’re a burden on families. If families could be better supported in helping an ailing family member then people wouldn’t feel that way as much, according to Bach. “I think people are turning to assisted suicide as a way of solving what is essentially a policy issue, because there are no other options.”

He believes that the push for physician-assisted death will reinforce stereotypes that receiving support from others is something to be ashamed of, which may influence more people’s decisions in this matter.

While CACL is vehemently opposed to the ruling, it will work with the situation as it is, rather than as the organization would like it to be. “We continue to be of the view that assisted suicide would not have been legalized. We continue to be against it. Some have proposed using the Notwithstanding Clause to uphold the ban in the Criminal Code and basically go against the Supreme Court’s decision, but that’s not the approach we’re taking. Because one way or another, I don’t think that’s politically viable.” Instead, he plans to focus on ensuring that enough checks and balances are in place to keep the actual number of assisted suicides to a minimum. “The law has changed, and so we want to get the most robust safeguard system possible in place to minimize, as much as possible, the authorization.”

The association will be submitting proposals for these safeguards to the panel, but Bach described what CACL hopes to emphasize, “…and that’s that disabilities should not be a reason for getting physician-assisted death.  The disability itself cannot be a reason.”  He also stressed that assisted suicide should <em>always</em> be just one aspect of the conversation when it comes to options for people who are suffering, and it should always be a last resort. “Before this intervention can be approved, the full range of alternatives needs to be considered, and an assessment of whether a person is in a vulnerable situation [must be performed]. Those dimensions of vulnerability need to be identified, and if they exist, alternatives to address them need to be considered, and I think this is a pretty reasonable approach.”

Another tricky subject is how the process would work for somebody interested in assisted suicide. Bach said that the family physician should not be the one to administer the treatment, as it would be a conflict of interest. “The role of physicians by virtue of the Hippocratic Oath is to do no harm, to heal, to provide interventions that address someone’s physical and psychological well-being.” Bach believes that putting them into a position of being able to proactively lead to somebody’s death is at odds with that oath, and that everything should be done to “…protect the integrity of the relationship between patients and doctors.”

“[It’s] not the same as the right to refuse treatment,” Bach explained.  “When you’re asking a physician or a professional to step in to take proactive steps to kill you that crosses a line.”

So, CACL envisions the family doctor as only the first step in the process. A patient would express their desires to the physician, who would determine if they were in extreme enough pain and if they had the capacity to make the decision. If so, the doctor would then refer them to a counsellor who would assess their level of vulnerability, and whether all alternative courses of action had been considered. Then, all of this information would go to a review board that would make a final decision.

“We want to make sure that [these steps] are only taken in the most extreme circumstances, after we’ve done absolutely everything possible, as a community, to support this person, and that the pain and suffering is so absolutely excruciating and nothing can relieve it, and the person fully understands the nature and consequences of what this intervention is going to mean,” Bach stated, in no uncertain terms. Only once these conditions have been met does he believe that an assisted suicide should be authorized, and, in the interest of full transparency, the board should release annual reports on how many people were approved and the exact nature of their situations. In addition, he emphasized that, to avoid coercion or other undesirable possibilities, the individual person who is suffering <em>must</em> be the one pushing for this, during their time of need. It cannot be an advance decision, he told Update Friday, nor can someone with power-of-attorney be allowed to make this determination. “So if a person needs support to make this kind of decision, we would say that they’re not eligible to make it,” he said.  “A person has to, on their own, fully understand the nature and consequences of this decision.”

Bach is worried that Canada won’t be able to institute all of these safety measures in time for the panel report’s February 6<sup>th</sup>, 2016 deadline, though he does believe that they can ensure that all of these factors are included in the conversation. “I don’t expect we’re going to have a national palliative care framework and a new framework for access to comprehensive disability supports by that time, but we’ll certainly be pushing that this conversation include consideration of those factors, even while we move into designing the elements of the safeguard system.”

I do not agree with you in regards to being able to control pain unless we allow more people to have medical marijuana, holistic energy medicines being recognized etc.  I as a very competent adult would not want to live in a body that becomes my prison and I would like to option to be allowed to die with dignity.  I cannot speak for anyone else and assisted suicide in no way should be used without the strictest of controls.  I know that there are always two sides two this argument and I know that this is an extremely difficult situation]]></wp:comment_content>

<p style="color: #000000;">A former President and lifetime member of <a style="color: #0074c8;" href="http://eblast.gotenzing.com/t/r-l-auuhyul-l-f/" target="_blank"><strong>Community Living Essex County</strong></a> with a strong connection to Community Living Ontario, Tim was known for his leadership and advocacy for people with intellectual disabilities.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">As a former educator and principal with the Windsor-Essex Catholic District School Board, he believed strongly in including children and youth with significant disabilities into regular classes in his schools.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“He gained a bit of a reputation for really challenging some of the Board policies at the time and some of the practices that were going on, and he really became a strong advocate for families and people with disabilities,” says Nancy Wallace-Gero, Executive Director of Community Living Essex County.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">When Wallace-Gero would visit Tim, “There would be children with significant challenges being assisted by other children in the school and we’re talking in the 80s, long before many [schools] were doing that. He was a man ahead of his time in so many ways.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">It was his leadership, progressive nature and his commitment to people that made Community Living Essex County take notice. Tim joined the Board in 1986, the same year that Wallace-Gero was hired. She credits him with helping to rebuild the organization and with strengthening its capacity.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“He was an amazing leader to be able to pull the Board together, develop a really strong foundation for the role of the Board and, really, made my coming into an organization that had a lot of challenges much easier.”<!--more--></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">As Coughlin became accustomed with the Board at Community Living Essex County, he got involved with a number of initiatives in the Developmental Services Sector, participating in many working groups struck by the Ministry.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“He provided terrific leadership in a lot of those types of forums in those days, where we were really working hard to build the capacity of our community to be able to provide the kind of services that we would eventually offer as the institutions were phased down and closed.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Tim later became involved with Community Living Ontario as a Director in 1991 and then as Vice President from 1992 to 1994.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">He helped organize a rally at Queen’s Park to protest government cuts to services in November 1992. 4,000 members from local associations attended the rally.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“I can remember him standing up on the hill at Queen’s Park with a microphone in his hand and talking to the crowds up there,” says Wallace-Gero, fondly.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">It was also during Tim’s time on the Board that Community Living Ontario was asked to participate in a working group struck by the Ministry of Community and Social Services, looking at alternatives to sheltered workshops.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Although Coughlin gradually stepped away from the Board of Directors at Community Living Essex County in the later 1990s, he stayed connected with the organization through his participation on various committees.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">In 2011, he chaired the 50th Anniversary Celebration Committee and Wallace-Gero says he did that “on behalf of the Past Presidents, and it was really nice to have him involved in that.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">During her 29 years with Community Living Essex County, she has had the pleasure of working with 15 Presidents. While each has brought their own passion and made their mark, Wallace-Gero says “Tim holds a really special place, partly because of the issues and challenges that the organization was facing back in 1986. If it wasn’t for Tim taking on that role of being as involved as he was with the organization at that time, I don’t know whether we’d be where we are today.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“Community Living Essex County is a better place because of Tim Coughlin.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Tim is survived by his wife, Marie, their kids Monique, Colette and Tim and their seven grandchildren.</p>

				<title>S.T.A.R. Abuse Prevention Program Shines Brightly</title>
		<link>http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/?p=376</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="color: #000000;">Abuse is something that, in any form, should never be taken lightly, and <a style="color: #0074c8;" href="http://eblast.gotenzing.com/t/r-l-auuhyul-l-z/" target="_blank"><strong>Community Living Port Colborne-Wainfleet</strong> </a>(CLPCW) has launched a program that is designed to address the problem before it starts.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Stop.Think. Act. Report. (S.T.A.R.) was created to teach participants how to identify and prevent abuse. The idea came from a Stratford-based self-advocacy group that presented a similar program to <a style="color: #0074c8;" href="http://eblast.gotenzing.com/t/r-l-auuhyul-l-v/" target="_blank"><strong>People Helping People Achieve</strong></a> (PHPA), a self-advocacy group from the Port Colborne area. Following this meeting, the PHPA group began to brainstorm how they could create their own unique presentation that was tailored to their community.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Update Friday spoke with Clint Tyrrell, a self-advocate from PHPA and Kim Simons, Coordinator at CLPCW, who talked about the fundamentals of the S.T.A.R. program.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“With S.T.A.R., we wanted to focus on opening up the lines of communication for a lot of people who have had a hard time dealing with personal experiences,” says Simons.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><a href="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/STAR-group.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-377" src="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/STAR-group-300x202.jpg" alt="STAR group" width="300" height="202" /></a>S.T.A.R. teaches participants to identify and diffuse abusive situations before they even start. Moreover, the group wants participants to feel comfortable sharing their experiences and communicating, so that they can help to recognize issues they may need help to address.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The presentation concentrates on five forms of abuse: verbal, physical, sexual, financial, and neglect. Clint Tyrrell, who is also the lead facilitator for the physical abuse portion of the presentation, spoke about his involvement in the project.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“As someone who has been bullied and, as a result, became a bully, I wanted to be involved in something that was productive and helpful to people trying to overcome difficult experiences.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The interactive program uses several methods to encourage participation including discussion, videos and role playing scenarios. “We have found that the role playing portion really gets people involved in the activities, allowing them to express their feelings as well as learn different ways to diffuse situations,” says Simons.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">S.T.A.R. was created with the intention of moving away from traditional training and procedures that deal with handling abusive situations. According to Simons and Tyrrell, communication is the key to success. “We talk a lot about having a safe person, someone participants can speak to when they feel they are being abused or in a difficult position,” says Simons.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Community Living Port Colborne-Wainfleet and People Helping People Achieve will be presenting their program at <a style="color: #0074c8;" href="http://eblast.gotenzing.com/t/r-l-auuhyul-l-e/" target="_blank"><strong>Community Living Ontario’s 62nd Annual Conference and AGM</strong></a>.</p>

That’s why she, along with colleagues Sadia Shaukat and Annie Zhang, will be discussing “Building Family Networks and Cultural Competence” at Community Living Ontario’s 62nd Annual Conference and AGM.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Singarayer, who has been with the association for 12 years, has been involved in almost every aspect of its operation, having held positions in community support, supported independent living and many day programs on the path to her current post. Her varied positions have made it clear to her that there are far more people in her area that need support than they have the capacity to provide for.  CLYS’ government-funded programs can provide for approximately 350 to 400 people in direct services, such as day programs and supported independent living.  Meanwhile, they can only provide certain outreach services for the 1,500 individuals on their regional waitlist.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Many of these people have difficulty navigating the services that are available to them in the meantime, due to language and cultural barriers. CLYS serves Richmond Hill, Markham, Stouffville, Thornhill and Vaughan, and according to Singarayer, “If I just told you to think about the population in those areas, there’s one word you’ll use to descri
be it, and that’s that it is so diverse.” She cited a newspaper article estimating that 52% of Markham residents have a Chinese background. “So I am of the mind,” she followed, “that if we don’t have people who can speak Cantonese or Mandarin, how are we going to effectively make change in those people’s lives?”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Expanding the concept to more communities, she asked “If the community is such that you have a high population of Cantonese, Mandarin-speaking people, or Punjabi, Hindi-speaking people, or Farsi-speaking people, the question begs as to how are you supporting those people.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Language barriers caused major setbacks for an immigrant family that Singarayer supported several years ago. Their son had a diagnosed disability, and yet they didn’t receive financial help for nearly a decade, simply because they didn’t know it was available. “I couldn’t believe it,” Singarayer said, exasperated. “It was almost something in the range of 10 years they could have been applying for ODSP and they had no idea.” The family had received an ODSP brochure upon entering the country, but it got lost in the shuffle since it was written in a language they didn’t fully understand—English.<!--more--></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">There are broader concerns here than just language issues—differing cultural backgrounds come into play, as well. In some cultures, there is still a great stigma attached to having a child with an intellectual disability, and so families keep it to themselves, possibly unaware that things are different in Canada.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">To combat this, CLYS has worked to reach out to community organizations these groups may be involved in. The association has partnered with Welcome Centres and community agencies to get the message of its services out there, and they have done presentations at different faith homes—churches, synagogues and mosques—to help spread the word.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">By doing this, CLYS hopes to broaden a family’s vision for their son or daughter. Once the association does make contact, Singarayer said that the most importa<img src="http://www.sagennext.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Ritu-2010.gif" alt="" width="240" height="200" align="right" hspace="5" />nt support a person can get in such circumstances is familial. The association’s motto is ‘Help families to help themselves.’  “They look at us,” she described, “and they sometimes say ‘You’re the expert.’ And we say ‘No, no, no. You’re the expert. You know your son or daughter much better than I know them.’”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">While the goal is for the person with the disability to be independent, she understands that the reality is they’ll need a lot of help from their family to get there, and so CLYS points them in the direction of services that can help them. This can include linking them to other families within the same cultural community, helping them to feel like they are not alone.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Singarayer and her coworkers will be expanding on all of these topics of inclusion in their presentation at the AGM. In the meantime, the one thing she would like attendees to consider leading up to the event is “…com[ing] to the session with an open mind, thinking ‘How can we think outside the box?  How can we, as an organization, respond better to diversity?’ I’m hoping they can get some answers that question.”</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="color: #000000;">Dan Steeves may represent the best of what a Community Living association hopes for the people it works with to achieve. With help from<a style="color: #0074c8;" href="http://eblast.gotenzing.com/t/r-l-flhdjtt-l-k/"> <strong>Community Living North Perth’s</strong></a> Summer Supports program, Dan, 20, has taken initiative to make life better for people with disabilities in his community, volunteering his time to help make some local businesses more accessible.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #0074c8;" href="http://eblast.gotenzing.com/t/r-l-flhdjtt-l-u/"><strong>Summer Supports</strong></a> is a free program that has been offered through Community Living North Perth for about 20 years. It assists students aged 14 to 21 in achieving their goals. “What we really like to focus on is ‘a typical teenage summer,’” says Summer Supports Supervisor Carolyn Bender.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">
<a href="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Danny-Steeves-Stop-Gap-North-Perth.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-390" src="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Danny-Steeves-Stop-Gap-North-Perth-300x225.jpg" alt="Danny Steeves - Stop Gap North Perth" width="300" height="225" /></a>According to Dan’s Summer Supports worker, Taylor Stone, this includes both skill-based goals, like getting a driver’s license, and recreational goals, like taking a trip to Wonderland.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">When Dan first got involved with the program in 2008, at age 14, one of his goals was learning to operate his motorized wheelchair. It is easy to see how this may have influenced his current direction.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“In 2014, I noticed that there isn’t many places around here that are wheelchair-accessible,” Dan told Update Friday, “so I thought to myself ‘What can we do here?’  That’s when I came across <a style="color: #0074c8;" href="http://eblast.gotenzing.com/t/r-l-flhdjtt-l-o/"><strong>Stop Gap</strong></a>.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Founded in Vancouver, Stop Gap installs ramps at community establishments in order to make them more inclusive. Some Ontarian associations have adopted the plan, and Dan, through his research, brought the program to Listowel, North Perth.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Dan’s work is beneficial to all businesses, which, according to an AODA ruling, must be accessible by 2025. “The vision of Stop Gap,” he said, “is to bring portable ramps to businesses as a temporary solution until the town can implement their current plans to become totally accessible. This will enable not only wheelchairs, but people with walkers, strollers, canes, artificial knees, and anyone with mobility issues to enjoy a barrier-free environment…Stop Gap allows everyone to enter the building with ease and dignity."</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">"Our goal is to 1) create awareness about barriers that prevent people from enjoying some of the amazing buildings our town has to offer, and 2) to help businesses embrace the upcoming AODA-built environment which in the near future will make it law for them to be barrier-free.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">After noticing that some of the local businesses were not inclusive in this way, he enlisted the help of Summer Supports, which did much of the legwork.  The local Home Hardware donated all of the materials so that the ramps could be provided to businesses at no charge, and they were assembled by students in Shop classes at Dan’s school.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Response has been great so far, as, according to Dan, “A few weeks ago, we actually did a kickoff in front of one of the stores, and that was really well-received.” The group has been sharing its efforts on social media, hoping to raise awareness.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">It’s been a positive experience for Dan so far, as, while a few businesses were not so receptive, he has learned that “…people are really open to new ideas.”  Six ramps have been built so far, and Dan knows of at least two more stores that he’d like to get on board.  Beyond that, he is continuing to take some online English courses, and has started his own motivational speaking business. He has a speaking event lined up for November 6th in Wingham, and has a few under his belt already.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The topic?  Inclusion, of course.</p>

				<title>Septic Tanks Allegedly Discovered in Huronia Cemetery; May Have Disturbed Graves</title>
		<link>http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/?p=401</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="color: #000000;">Governmental setbacks continue to shock members of the Remember Every Name committee, the group of concerned citizens, survivors, and relatives of survivors of the shuttered Huronia Regional Centre. They are attempting to put names to every grave in the Centre’s severely under-documented cemetery. It was already known that many graves are marked only by the individual’s institution number, and a large number are completely unmarked. Adding further insult to injury, last month the group says it discovered a septic tank pipeline running right through where a large group of people were supposedly buried.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">When Huronia and Ontario’s other two major institutions were closed down in 2009, survivors instituted a class-action lawsuit against the government, which settled in 2013.  In addition to a promised $35 million for victims and their families—payouts for which still haven’t been received—the agreement called for a public apology for the tortures and deaths suffered there, and for government assistance to document names, years of birth, and years of death for approximately 2,000 people buried at the cemetery. Remember Every Name has found the discovery of the septic tanks during this investigation offensive.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“These poor people were not even treated like human beings in life, and they’re not treated like humans in a graveyard,” said Dr. Jerry Melbye, a Forensic Anthropologist specializing in the identification of human remains. He says he joined Remember Every Name after learning that the government had no plans to locate the bodies of certain people buried at the cemetery.  “They’re just nameless numbers, and it’s god-awful.”<a href="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/li-huronia.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-259" src="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/li-huronia-300x168.jpg" alt="li-huronia" width="300" height="168" /></a></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“The septic tanks themselves were not mentioned in the survey,” he continued, referring to the archaeological survey commissioned by the government to find the boundaries of the cemetery. “There’s these things labelled on the map, just known as ‘Utilities.’” Wondering just what these utilities were, the group unearthed and opened the septic tanks, which were installed in the 1950s and remained in use until the 1970s. They found that the pipes, which go uphill toward a former residential area, go right through the plot where Huronia occupants who died in the 1930s were buried.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">For the deceased, this does not just mean suffering the indignity of having human waste travelling right by one’s grave. The pipeline is four feet deep. Most of the burial sites are between 1 foot and four feet underground, meaning up to 150 graves could have been disturbed when the pipes were laid. “If they disturbed the burials that means they intersected bones,” Melbye said. “Human bones. And what did they do with them? We don’t know. Did they throw them back in the trench when they buried the pipe? We don’t know.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Melbye and Remember Every Name find it suspicious that the archaeological company, Timmins Martel Heritage Consultant Inc., which surveyed the area, did not point out that anything may be amiss in that area. Its maps had rectangles representing the areas it charted with ground-penetrating radar. The area containing the pipes and graves in question had no rectangle. “That part of the cemetery wasn’t surveyed where those pipelines would have shown up,” Melbye pointed out.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The septic tanks aren’t the only recently-uncovered issue with the cemetery. Melbye is concerned that certain people’s bones may not have been recognized as such. “They found some supposed animal bones. They had cut marks on them, and so they deemed them to be cow bones, or domestic animal bones. And they’re lying on a cedar plank, they never even entertained the idea for an instant that those cedar planks might be the remains of a coffin.” These bones were disposed of, even though Melbye believes there’s a high chance that the planks were part of a coffin, and that the bones were human.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Melbye, who taught Anthropology at the University of Toronto for over 30 years and regularly helps police identify bodies, can tell if a bone is human or animal by looking at a small fragment. However, these bones were discarded without being studied by a certified expert in Osteology, the study of bones.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Decidedly displeased with these bureaucratic disruptions, Melbye told a representative from the ministry previously handling this case that he no longer trusts the archaeological company, and that certain things should be re-examined. “Basically,” Melbye related, “he said it’s a done deal and he’s going to get some sewer experts in there, and that’s it. He wasn’t going to go back to the archaeology company at all.” A lawyer for the same ministry advised Melbye not to write to the Premier about these struggles, and to deal with him directly.  “How can we do that when we don’t trust him?”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Remember Every Name ignored this man’s advice and wrote to Premier Wynne anyway.  In an open letter sent July 23, member Paola di Paolo requested, on behalf of the group and Dr. Melbye, “An independent and professional assessment of the septic tanks and septic pipes in HRC cemetery[,] an independent and professional assessment of the state of the graves that were disturbed by the installation of the above mentioned pipes[, and] an independent and professional assessment of what would be involved in decommissioning the septic system and removing the pipe that lies across graves.” She also requested that Remember Every Name be allowed to select the party that would perform such tasks.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Survivor Cindy Scott expressed her heartfelt feelings to the Premier in a followup letter. Some gravestones had been removed, at one point, to build the patio of a nearby house, and while they’ve since been returned, they are a gigantic cement block placed in an arbitrary location. Hundreds more are simply missing. In response to the five to six hundred gravestones that are unaccounted for, Scott questioned, “Why has nobody talked about it or told us what really happened to the missing gravestones.  I think people don’t want the truth, they just want to make excuses. Why would it be allowed to put pipes through a graveyard?  Just because it happened a long time ago doesn’t make it ok.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">At this point, the response from the Premier’s office has been to move the Huronia case from its previous home at the Ministry of Community and Social Services to the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services, which is the standard department for graveyard issues. With this change, “Hopefully, something is going to get done,” Melbye said. “The sewer system just shocked everyone, and I must say that the survivors are just up in arms. There are many survivors that have held back telling their stories, and they’re about ready to spill the beans, they’re so angry.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Scott is livid, saying that the issue of the missing graves, among the other problems, “makes me mad, sad, upset, shaking my head.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“Sewage pipes?” she asked. “The water from 65 years [ago] could have washed through the dirt and moved where people are supposed to be. We want to figure out how they got the pipes in the ground.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">More succinctly, she stated “I have a right to know exactly what happened.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">As upsetting as all of this is, Melbye hopes survivors can take heart in Remember Every Name’s steadfast efforts for justice. “My message to them is ‘We’re working hard to make things right.’ You can never completely right wrongs of this magnitude, but we are going to really, really try to see that the best possible thing can come from this as far as the cemetery is concerned.”</p>

<hr style="color: #000000;" />
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>Update Friday reached out to the Ministry of Community and Social Services, which provided the following response:</strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><em>We appreciate the recent concerns from Remember Every Name about the Huronia Regional Centre (HRC) Cemetery.</em></p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><em>The concerns come as a result of a Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) survey map that was commissioned to confirm the boundary of the cemetery to help determine the location for the perimeter fence that would ensure no graves were disturbed and allow families the space to move more easily around the cemetery when visiting their loved ones.</em></p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><em>This GPR report map shows that there are utilities located within the current boundaries of the cemetery. However, Infrastructure Ontario (IO), who manages the property on behalf of the province, conducted a site visit last week and determined that there are no active utilities located within the cemetery. The GPR survey did not reveal the path of sewer pipes.</em></p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><em>The Ministry of Community and Social Services is working with IO to further investigate the concerns that have been raised and will conduct an additional evaluation of the cemetery. They will determine the path of any pipes (which are estimated to have been  laid more than 60 years ago).</em></p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><em>IO’s investigation plans do not involve disturbing any graves.</em></p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><em>We are committed to getting answers to concerns that have been raised with respect to the HRC Cemetery. We have worked with Remember Every Name and will continue to work with them once our investigation is complete, in order to determine the best way forward based on our findings.</em></p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><em>The contributions from Remember Every Name and the findings of the investigation will be key as we continue our work to honour the former residents and families of former residents of the Huronia Regional Centre.

Last winter, Jenna decided to begin swimming the equivalent distance between her hometown of Kingston, Ontario and British Colombia. Her goal? To raise funds and awareness about dolphins and the pollution that is rapidly destroying their habitat.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #0074c8;" href="http://eblast.gotenzing.com/t/r-l-fqtykd-l-u/" target="_blank"><strong>Update Friday</strong></a> had a chance to speak with Margaret McLauchlan, caregiver and friend of Jenna, who told us that the idea to organize a fundraiser came after their trip to a We Day event. “I took Jenna to one of the <a style="color: #0074c8;" href="http://eblast.gotenzing.com/t/r-l-fqtykd-l-o/" target="_blank"><strong>Free the Children We Day</strong></a> events, where she saw Spencer West speak about making a difference in the world.” West, a motivational speaker who lost both of his legs at a young age, is one of Jenna’s heroes.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Following the event, Jenna decided that she wanted to make a positive difference in the world. “Her goal was to accomplish two things, educate and fundraise. She knew how hard people work for their money and that she would have to make a huge effort in whatever it was she wanted to do,” said McLauchlan.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“When Jenna was born with Cerebral Palsy, we were told that she wouldn’t be able to walk or talk. We decided that we would do everything in our power for her to reach her full potential. She had very active physiotherapy when she was younger which involved swimming, it made a huge difference,” said Jenna’s mother Karen Gregg, who has been supporting Jenna every step of the way.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Jenna decided to swim 3,534 laps at the <a style="color: #0074c8;" href="http://eblast.gotenzing.com/t/r-l-fqtykd-l-b/" target="_blank"><strong>Artillery Park Aquatic Centre</strong></a>, the equivalent distance between Kingston and the<a style="color: #0074c8;" href="http://eblast.gotenzing.com/t/r-l-fqtykd-l-n/" target="_blank"><strong> Vancouver Aquarium's Marine Mammal Rescue Centre</strong></a>. “Jenna chose to fundraise for the rescue centre after looking online and finding out that they were the only dolphin rescue centre in Canada,” said McLauchlan.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Jenna’s passion for dolphins and her determination to accomplish her goal had her swimming between 70 and 80 laps every Tuesday night.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The community has rallied around Jenna’s fundraising efforts, with many locals taking interest in her reaching her goal and others donating to the cause. “Every single Tuesday, we have several regulars who will come out to the pool to support Jenna and ask how close she is to reaching her goal,” said McLauchlan.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The Vancouver Aquarium’s Marine Mammal Rescue Centre has also recognized Jenna’s efforts. In two weeks, Jenna will be visiting the aquarium where she will receive a special behind the scenes tour of the exhibits. The aquarium has also named a recently rescued harbour seal after Jenna.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">This past Tuesday, Jenna completed her goal of 3,534 laps which was followed by a celebration that many of Jenna’s friends and local supporters attended.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Here at Update Friday, it is always refreshing to hear stories about individuals who focus on their abilities rather than their disabilities. Congratulations to Jenna Gregg on a successful fundraiser and the completion of her goal.</p>

<p style="color: #000000;">The <a style="color: #0074c8;" href="http://eblast.gotenzing.com/t/r-l-fykuyky-l-w/" target="_blank"><strong>2015 Special Olympics World Games</strong></a> in Los Angeles went swimmingly for Bill Smith, 51, who took home the gold medal for the 25-metre Freestyle event and silver for the equivalent Backstroke race. The Games ran from July 25th until August 2nd.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">A member of <a style="color: #0074c8;" href="http://eblast.gotenzing.com/t/r-l-fykuyky-l-yd/" target="_blank"><strong>Community Living Cambridge</strong></a>, Bill finished the former event with a time of 30.56 seconds and the latter in 39.89 seconds. He also placed fourth in the Freestyle Relay race, and described his thoughts during the events as “Trying to do my best.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">While he is the second Cambridge athlete to participate in the games, he is the first to win a medal of any sort, let alone gold. The previous entrant was Derek Dumbrell, who competed in 10-pin Bowling in 2002.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Bill worked hard to get this far, having practiced “since last Fall until the World Games. I went to the pool by myself.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">He qualified for the Games when he won golds in the 25 and 50-metre Backstroke events and the 50-metre Freestyle race at the 2014 National Games in Vancouver. Before that, he won four golds at the Ontario provincial Games in Kingston.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“I had a great time in Los Angeles,” he recounted, remembering how his trip went outside of the Games. “We went to the Science Museum. Before the Games, we went to Orange County, we went to an Angels game, and we went to a fair.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">When he’s not swimming or working at his position at the local Sobeys, Bill enjoys 10-pin bowling, basketball and going for long walks. He also volunteers at St. Vincent de Paul Value Centre, a Cambridge thrift store that assists people with low incomes, women’s crisis centres, fire victims, and individuals in transition.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="color: #000000;">
<a href="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/LukeFlynn.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-416" src="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/LukeFlynn-300x234.jpg" alt="LukeFlynn" width="300" height="234" /></a>People are often told that they can be whatever they want, but we all know that isn’t necessarily true. The truth is we can try to be whatever we want, but the outcome is never certain. Luke Flynn never stops trying. He doesn’t have everything he wants, yet he has celebrated many victories.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Never mind his college graduation, his move from Peterborough to Picton, his many swimming medals, his first apartment, his public speaking engagements or any of his many accomplishments before the fall of 2014. Life isn’t about achieving one dream, it’s about a journey to fulfillment; the pursuit of dreams.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“Hey Sam, it’s me Luke. I got the job!”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">I was there the day Luke called Sam, his 6’2” twin brother. It was a couple of weeks before Christmas and Sam was in some remote part of Northern Canada, a diamond mine or oil field which needed his skills as a commercial driller.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Luke, who stands about 5’, sounded like a man twice that height. I have had the privilege of being part of some wonderful moments, but that phone call was profoundly touching.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">When March rolled around, Luke went off to Toronto to participate in the <a style="color: #0074c8;" href="http://eblast.gotenzing.com/t/r-l-fykuyky-l-s/" target="_blank"><strong>2015 Youth Summit</strong></a>, as part of TO2015’s Building Legacies Youth Engagement program in conjunction with the 2015 Pan Am Games. He even made it into the Youth Summit flash mob video on YouTube!</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">In April, Luke received the Civic Recognition award from Prince Edward County Council. He was recognized for bringing positive recognition to the County. Specifically, Luke was recognized for his exceptional personal accomplishments and his commitment and contributions to the County of Prince Edward.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Luke has worked hard at his job with the OPP, which has opened up a whole new set of opportunities. He was asked if he would carry the torch for the Special Olympics Law Enforcement Torch Run and he gladly accepted. The more Luke engages in his community, the more his community engages him and the benefits that flow from these relationships are life changing.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Life moves on from our wins just as it moves on from our losses. There is more to try and Luke is up for the challenge.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">- <strong>Jason Sweet</strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>Community Support Worker   </strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><em>Editor’s note: Thank you to Community Living Prince Edward for sharing Luke’s story. We can’t wait to see what he’ll accomplish next!</em></p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><em>Do you have a story you think we should feature in a future edition of Update Friday?

				<title>Celebrating Our Differences Focus of New Toolkit</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="color: #000000;"><a href="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/diversitycollage.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-420" src="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/diversitycollage-300x168.jpg" alt="diversitycollage" width="300" height="168" /></a></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Just because a self-advocate has an intellectual disability, it doesn’t mean that’s the only challenge they may face with respect to inclusion and equity. Other aspects of their identity, such as ethnicity or sexual orientation may play a role as well. Ilaneet Goren, Diversity Specialist at<a style="color: #0074c8;" href="http://eblast.gotenzing.com/t/r-l-fjkltdd-l-a/"><strong> Community Living Toronto</strong></a>, will be presenting solutions to this problem at <a style="color: #0074c8;" href="http://eblast.gotenzing.com/t/r-l-fjkltdd-l-f/"><strong>Community Living Ontario’s 62nd Annual Conference and AGM</strong></a>, in a presentation called “Bridging Diversity Toolkit: Tools and Resources for Embracing our Differences, Finding Commonalities, and Making Our Communities More Inclusive of Everyone.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Goren describes the<a style="color: #0074c8;" href="http://eblast.gotenzing.com/t/r-l-fjkltdd-l-z/"><strong> Bridging Diversity Toolkit</strong></a>, a free resource hosted on <a style="color: #0074c8;" href="http://eblast.gotenzing.com/t/r-l-fjkltdd-l-v/"><strong>ConnectAbility.ca</strong></a>, as “an interactive way to learn and talk about diversity in simple and accessible ways. We looked at how we’re all celebrating our differences, acknowledging our common humanity, and focusing on our commonalities. How do we work together to build more inclusive and diversity-minded communities?”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The Toolkit, funded by the Ontario Trillium Foundation, contains resources to help foster discussions around diversity, the ways in which we are all the same, and how the situation can be made better for everyone. This includes videos of people who have lived experience in this area. “So you have people from diverse cultural backgrounds, diverse faiths, sexual orientations, and gender identities,” Goren explained, “so there’s many different layers of diversity.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“It also teaches people about intrasectionality[, ] What does it mean to have different parts of yourself, of your identity, intersecting to create a very unique and very particular experience? And also, what are some barriers and challenges that people face because of those intersections? So, for example, what does it mean to be a person of colour and have an intellectual disability? What does it mean to have a trans-identified person with an intellectual disability?”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Having such people discuss their own experiences in the videos has been a success so far. sprOUT Toronto  is an inclusive program for LGBTQ individuals with intellectual disabilities that is operated jointly by Griffin Centre, Community Living Toronto and Vita Community Living Services, with Goren serving as a co-facilitator. She showed the videos to the group and they were very well-received. “This particular group of people with gender diversity and sexual orientation diversity, for them to hear their realities reflected and being openly discussed in a positive way is huge. Especially for people with disabilities.” sprOUT Toronto meets every second Monday at the 519 Church St. Community Centre.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">She believes that society’s challenge is to “create an environment that is safe, positive, and inclusive for people with multiple and diverse needs and abilities. We also talk about how we’re similar to each other, and what can we do to make things better for everyone.” Everything in the Toolkit is written out in plain language that can be used in any community setting.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">One of Community Living Toronto’s programs, Foster’s Clubhouse, will be having an event to screen the videos to staff and people supported. However, the association hopes to use Community Living Ontario’s conference as a real launchpad, as it’s the first time the Toolkit will be shown publicly to a wide audience. According to Goren, participating in the event “really allows us to use networks and to hear from other agencies about what their thoughts are on diversity-related issues and challenges that they’re experiencing, share resources, [and] learn ourselves.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">In closing, Goren stressed that she hopes the Toolkit will be a conversation-starter for diversity, inclusion, and equity in this sector, and they will be constantly seeking new content to help it grow. “We will continue to upload links, resources and handouts and sharing best practices. So, we hope that, in the next couple of years, it will continue to grow and grow, so that people will get excited about submitting ideas to us.”</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="color: #000000;">For the past 25 years, Community Living Algoma has offered employment services for the people they support in their community. This summer, the association launched a summer employment program geared to transitional-aged youth.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><a href="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/uf5.084148.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-428" src="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/uf5.084148-300x177.jpg" alt="uf5.084148" width="300" height="177" /></a>Update Friday spoke with Kim Metzen, Manager of the Employment Support Program at Community Living Algoma. She says although the employment support program was well established, they “…never ventured into support for students.” That is, until recently.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The idea to provide job opportunities for young people was the result of an information session that Community Living Algoma co-hosted earlier this year.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“What really changed the outlook for Community Living Algoma was an information session hosted by PossAbility Community Homes, in partnership with Autism Ontario Sault Ste. Marie and Community Living Algoma [in January],” says Metzen.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The session featured guest speakers Mark Wafer and Joe Dale, who spoke about the benefits of employment programs and services for people with a disability, including youth.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Once the initial idea for the program was conceived, the team incorporated several elements from the Transitions to Employment Toolkits that were developed by Community Living Sarnia-Lambton, Community Living Chatham-Kent and Community Living Wallaceburg, which was featured in last week’s Update Friday. The toolkit includes resources to launch turnkey employment and job readiness programs for young people.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">In February, Community Living Algoma submitted a grant proposal through the Canada Summer Jobs program to help offset the costs of launching their project.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“In May, it was confirmed that we would be receiving [funds to hire] three job coaches for the summer that would work with the selected students,” says Metzen.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Three students were selected to participate in the program. Community Living Algoma partnered with Root River Golf Club, Service Rentals and Northshore Tractor to offer the students jobs that totaled 30 hours a week for each person.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">With the initial success of the pilot program, Community Living Algoma intends to involve a greater number of young people next year.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“One of our main areas going forward, based on the success of our summer employment program will be to focus on connecting with kids graduating from high school or college.  We see this as the area having the greatest potential at this time,” says Metzen.</p>

				<title>Push is on to Make Accessibility a Federal Election Issue</title>
		<link>http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/?p=430</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="color: #000000;">
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-431 size-full" src="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/uf4.034837.jpg" alt="uf4.034837" width="506" height="300" />A movement is underway to make a Canadians with Disabilities Act a priority in the 2015 federal election.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The Canadian Association for Community Living, Community Living Ontario and other provincial and territorial associations have made the topic part of a five-point plan that speaks to an inclusive labour market, economic opportunity, income security and community access for Canadians with disabilities and their families. This includes the creation and adoption of a Canadians with Disabilities Act.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Specifically, the Act would mandate accessibility standards in federally-regulated programs, facilities, benefits, communications and services. This legislation would be based on principles of universal design, effective participation, and equality of opportunity, and would be a major step in Canada meeting its obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Standards would be monitored, enforceable, and reported on to Parliament and Canadians every year by the responsible minister.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">To date, the Green Party of Canada is the only party to promise a Canadians with Disabilities Act as part of its platform.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">David Lepofsky, Chair of the AODA Alliance and disability accessibility advocate, says a Canadians with Disabilities Act is needed because some of the barriers people with disabilities face can only be regulated by the Canadian government, such as access to federal agencies like Canada Post and Revenue Canada. A number of other services and workplaces need to be regulated federally, including air travel, telecommunications and banking.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“We need to ensure full accessibility and we need the federal government to act.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The Ontario legislature unanimously adopted the Ontarians with Disabilities Act on October 29, 1998, thanks to a campaign led by Lepofsky and supported by Community Living Ontario, among others. A similar Act became law in Manitoba in 2013. Legislation is also being considered in Nova Scotia and British Columbia.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Lepofsky notes that the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the Canadian Human Rights Act ensure equality for people with disabilities, but in order to enforce those rights, people must sue.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“In Ontario, when I, as a blind person, wanted bus drivers to announce all bus stops, I had to sue the TTC personally.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">A Canadians with Disabilities Act, according to Lepofsky, could also ensure that federal dollars used on infrastructure and to buy goods and services couldn’t be used to create barriers against people with disabilities. Voluntary provincial standards could also be created to address barriers in areas such as education and health care, and provinces could then adopt them without having to create their own legislation.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">In addition to being Chair of the AODA Alliance, Lepofsky sits on the Steering Committee for Barrier-Free Canada, a non-partisan group also calling for the adoption of a Canadians with Disabilities Act.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The group has developed 14 principles based on those adopted in Ontario and Manitoba, and they cover all disabilities, barriers and how they can be effectively enforced.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Barrier-Free Canada has been busy reaching out to the parties and their candidates through social media, and Lepofsky says they’re encouraging people in the disabilities community to do the same.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“This is a very close election and it’s a long election campaign, so there’s time. Each of the parties knows that every vote counts, so people with disabilities, their families, their friends and people who care about them need to raise this [issue] with candidates at the door.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Barrier-Free Canada has developed an election action kit, which is available on their <a style="color: #0074c8;" href="http://eblast.gotenzing.com/t/r-l-fhykhyd-l-n/" target="_blank">website</a>. They have also started a conversation on Twitter using the hashtag #CanadiansWithDisabilitiesAct.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">As mentioned above, the Canadian Association for Community Living, Community Living Ontario and other provincial and territorial associations have committed to raising awareness about the barriers people face, with the development of a five-point plan for the 2015 federal election.

				<title>Toronto-area group committed to finding different housing options for people</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="color: #000000;">A group of parents from the Scarborough area remains dedicated to finding housing alternatives for their adult children, and their efforts continue to grow in scope and reach.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">When <strong>Scarborough Residential Alternatives</strong> (SRA) began in 2006, there were six families looking for something different than the traditional group home model.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>Bonnie Heath</strong>, one of the group’s founders, says Scarborough Residential Alternatives offers parents information on housing, along with encouragement and opportunities to network. They also rely on each other to come up with innovative ideas for alternative living arrangements for their sons and daughters.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><img class="alignleft" src="http://i1.createsend1.com/ei/r/23/39E/3B7/csimport/bonie.113910.jpg" alt="" width="293" height="139" />For Heath, a group home was not an option for her daughter, <strong>Jenny</strong>.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“I wanted something different that she had control of and that was more a part of the community.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">According to Heath, the families wanted to find alternative housing for their children, but didn’t want to wait until they were in their 90s to do so. Jenny has been living on her own for the past six years.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“She has a roommate and they have a live in, and she’s just part of the community. When she talks about home it’s her home, it’s not mine anymore. It’s been a total learning experience for her and her roommate, as well as for us, as parents,” says Heath.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Her daughter lives in a townhouse that’s part of a larger complex. When they first moved in, they held an open house for other tenants in the complex so that they could meet their new neighbours. Barbecues and other events have also been organized since their arrival.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Heath says she has seen tremendous personal growth in her daughter since Jenny found a place of her own.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“She would never have had that growth if she continued to live with me. It’s a hard sell to parents because we’re all over protective, but it’s also allowed me to get my life back. We’re still closely connected, but we still have our own separate lives.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">There are eight homes leased by people who have ties with SRA. The types of housing range from condos and townhomes to apartments and houses located in neighbourhoods across the city, not just Scarborough.Today, about 120 families are involved with SRA, and they stay in touch mostly through email.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The group submitted an innovative housing proposal earlier this year, as part of the <strong>Ministry of Community and Social Services’</strong><em>Developmental Services Housing Task Force</em>. It was turned down, but they intend to re-apply.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Heath is a member of the Housing Task Force, although she was not part of the Selection Committee that chose the 12 pilot projects that will receive funding.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“We had 80 organizations submit proposals. There’s a huge need and something has to be done that’s different than the way [the Ministry] does it now. Hopefully, the money should be starting to roll out to this first set of projects. From there, we’ll be able to see, over time, how well they work out. The objective of course is to see it work in other areas.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Heath is a strong supporter of individualized funding for residential supports so that people can live where they want and choose how they want to live their lives. However, she is not in favour of people with intellectual disabilities living together in large group homes.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“Originally, we had tried to get a floor of a building where they could all live. It wasn’t a group home, but it was the same sort of idea. Our proposal wasn’t accepted and, looking back, it was a good thing that is wasn’t because it’s much better the way we’ve done it.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Heath says she can appreciate why some families may want to push for a group home. However, she thinks having a large number of people living together is problematic and she’s in favour of people living in the community.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“There’s safety in the community, which people don’t seem to think there is. They all think it’s safer for their kids to be in a group home situation. But in the community where Jenny lives, the community looks out for her. I can appreciate why everyone looks at a group home, because it’s less expensive. But to live with 18 people, that’s a lot of people to live with.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">SRA has also developed a guide to assist parents with accessing funding and community supports to enable their sons and daughters to transition into homes of their own.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“I thought let’s make it a simple guide that’s got the Ministry’s web site. It also talks about ODSP and how you get the rent portion. A lot people don’t realize that when you rent somewhere, you receive a couple hundred dollars, approximately. It talks about your Passport dollars and what you can use it for, as well as person-directed planning and independent facilitation – a lot people get the plans done, but they don’t know how to implement the goals.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The guide is available for download by accessing Scarborough Residential Services’ <strong><a style="color: #0074c8;" href="http://eblast.gotenzing.com/t/r-l-zykthdk-l-k/" target="_blank">web site</a></strong>. Families can post ads on the web site for roommates that fit the criteria they’re looking for. SRA will also post notices for support workers.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Help students like Omar match their passion with purpose on #GivingTuesday with a donation to Community Living Ontario or support Student Links by becoming a mentor. </span></strong>

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">By making a financial commitment to Community Living Ontario, you are assisting youth like Omar Shehadeh. Omar loves taking pictures. That much is evident from his work presented at Community Living Ontario’s 6th Annual COMMENCE Conference this past winter. His photography showcased stunning lakeside sunsets, autumn forests with freshly fallen leaves and towering cityscapes. </span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Michelle Chappus, his mentor, says “He has a great eye and he’s a natural at taking pictures. He’s always taking pictures.” Sherry, Community Living Ontario’s Student Links Coordinator for the Windsor-Essex Region matched Chappus, a member of the Windsor Camera Club, with Omar. Chappus is a retired teacher who loves photography and working with youth. </span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">“Omar has opened up my eyes to the beauty around me, at times when I may have missed looking outside of the box from my own perspective.” <img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-450" src="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Omar-ACWR-002-ed-300x225.jpg" alt="Omar ACWR 002 ed" width="300" height="225" /> </span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">At Chappus’ urging, Omar joined the club and has been involved in three group shows. He’s found his passion for photography to be profitable, and he has started selling his work. As for the future, Omar plans on putting his skills to further use saying, “I probably want to be a wedding photographer.” </span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">A whole new world of possibilities opened up for Omar and for many other youth across Ontario because of the Student Links initiative.  <strong>You too can make a difference</strong> on #GivingTuesday. Your donation will help to support Community Living Ontario’s activities so that young people like Omar can find their passion and develop lasting relationships in their community.</span>

				<title>Jay Patel has some serious aspirations and skills to boot up your next web site!</title>
		<link>http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/?p=464</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It’s never too early to start planning for the future. That’s why Jay Patel, 15, hasn’t simply learned web development through Student Links—he’s developed a set of skills that he hopes will have a direct application to the family business. Patel worked with Rohit Prasad, his mentor and a recent graduate of Software Engineering and Industrial Design. Together, the pair designed a web site concept for his father’s metalwork company, D and J Fabrication in North York. Jay developed content and populated the web site. The best part was that the concept was not just an exercise—there are plans to launch the web site as part of his father’s business.

<a href="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Jay-and-Rohit.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-303" src="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Jay-and-Rohit-290x300.jpg" alt="Jay and Rohit" width="290" height="300" /></a>Jay’s excitement for learning was evident from the get-go. “Meeting Jay was really exciting because he reminded me of myself when I was in high school,” recalled Rohit. “He loves technology, he’s super eager to learn and he’s willing to try new things. So when we first met, we decided it would be a good idea to learn how to create a simple web site. I’d walk him through it and he could keep exploring other possibilities on his own.”

Jay seems to be doing just that. Not only is he developing the site for D and J Fabrication, he hopes to take over the company himself one day. He’s trained for that potential eventuality, having helped out over the years. “I’ve seen a lot of physical metal work, and I figured I felt strong enough to be able to take over that stuff,” he boasted. “I’ve known how to use a lot of machines. I use the welding machine. I use the punching machine, pretty much everything.”

Rohit gained something from spending time with Jay as well. “It was great being exposed to Jay’s eagerness to learn, but also at the same time, it felt great to impart knowledge, to be able to teach something you’re passionate about, and work with someone equally passionate about it.<strong> </strong>

Since their time together, Rohit has taken a job in Germany, but the positive relationship he developed with Jay has left its mark. “We’re going to keep in touch, and I like to think he’s learned as much from me as I did from the whole experience!”

The opportunity with Student Links has given Jay what he believes is a strong direction to focus on as he completes high school, saying “I’d like to start taking IT courses, business, stuff like that.”

In addition to possibly taking over the family business one day, Jay is exploring the idea of opening his own IT company, which may assist D and J Fabrication as well. Planning for the future, indeed!

A whole new world of possibilities opened up for Jay and for many other youth across Ontario because of the Student Links initiative. <strong>You too can make a difference</strong> on <strong>#GivingTuesday.</strong> Your donation will help to support Community Living Ontario’s activities so that students like Jay can find their passion and develop lasting relationships in their community.

				<title>Reyaz works out the Kinks, Rocks On</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[No one can tell Reyaz Sulaiman that his options for the future are limited. Through Student Links, Reyaz has had the opportunity to explore and learn from industry professionals in three distinct areas of passion – chiropractic medicine, the music industry, and a recently discovered love of public speaking.

“I was feeling really happy,” Reyaz said, when asked how he reacted to news that Paul, a chiropractor in North York, agreed to take him on as a student. Working with Paul and physiotherapist Chetana, he learned to operate the ultrasound machine, hot wax machine, Tens machine, heating pads and other equipment. He has had the opportunity to shadow assessments and to learn about chiropractic care.

<img class="alignright wp-image-469 size-medium" src="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ReyazDJing-4-300x193.jpg" alt="ReyazDJing (4)" width="300" height="193" />Reyaz is also a big fan of calypso and reggae music and especially dancehall rapper, musician and singer, Sean Paul. He submitted his favourite songs as part of his personal curated playlist that MuchMusic aired under his name in March. “I was so excited to see my name on the TV,” Reyaz proclaimed, grinning infectiously from ear to ear.

Far from just a friendly, inclusive gesture, the playlist turned out to be a shrewd business move. Gregg Stewart is Bell Media’s Associate Director of Music Marketing Strategy.

“Sean Paul has never failed to deliver, when it comes to numbers on radio and television, across this country or any country for that matter. It’s a known fact – a statistic, actually – that anything with those kind of vibes and his music, in particular, that it’s definitely an audience draw. When Reyaz sent us some ideas as to what it was he liked, we were all thrilled and excited to work with him to compile that hour of music.”

Asked how she views the positive experiences Reyaz has had, his mother Camille, summed it up succinctly. “Awesome, in one word.” It’s apparent that she has seen some changes in her son since he started getting hands-on experience in the areas he was interested in, saying “I’ve seen so much growth in him. It’s really been awesome. He’s just blossomed into being more responsible and more independent.”

As for future plans, Reyaz has recently discovered a love for public speaking. He is working with Marlon, a member of his local Toastmasters organization, to develop a story of his life. He isn’t quite sure what he’ll do with it, but he loves motivational speaking. “All of my cousins, my uncle,” he said, listing some of his family members who have encouraged him to talk in front of an audience. “I really like to speak in a crowd.”

A whole new world of possibilities opened up for Reyaz and for many other youth across Ontario because of the Student Links initiative. <strong>You too can make a difference</strong> on #GivingTuesday. Your donation will help to support Community Living Ontario’s activities so that students like Reyaz can find their passion and develop lasting relationships in their community.

				<title>Personal Outcome Measures Changing Lives, Building Community</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="color: #000000;">Nearly a year and a half into their commitment to improve service delivery, <a style="color: #0074c8;" href="http://eblast.gotenzing.com/t/r-l-zjutiz-l-b/"><strong>Community Living Upper Ottawa Valley</strong></a> (CLUOV), staff and people supported continue to reap the benefits of introducing personal outcome measures training.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Thanks to a three-year, $200,000 grant from the Ontario Trillium Foundation, CLUOV and the <strong><a style="color: #0074c8;" href="http://eblast.gotenzing.com/t/r-l-zjutiz-l-n/">Madawaska Valley Association for Community Living</a></strong> (MVACL) have been working with staff on a best practice model developed by the Council for Quality and Leadership (CQL).</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Beginning last year, employees at both organizations have been participating in workshops to enhance the lives of people with intellectual disabilities. In the case of CLUOV, that means approximately 100 staff have been receiving training to assist more than 150 people and their families.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">At the end of the three-year timeframe, CLUOV and MVACL will each have an interviewer and two trainers on staff to be able to continue to measure the quality of their service offerings.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The investment ha<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-473" src="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/teamwork.130135-300x177.jpg" alt="teamwork.130135" width="300" height="177" />s meant that CLUOV is positioned to better plan service delivery and increase opportunities for collaboration in the region. As part of their community outreach, CLUOV has met with 25 staff from a long-term care home in the area, as well as a representative from L’Arche.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>Tina Williams</strong>, Manager of Quality Enhancement for Community Living Upper Ottawa Valley, says the measures and the training are really about helping people determine their priorities and preferences, which impacts everyone.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“The outcome measures don’t only apply to people with disabilities. There’s a process that can be used with people who have mental health diagnoses and also people who are seniors. [The measures] are relevant to all of our lives. If we look at ourselves and we think about the things that are most important to us, they fit into the 21 personal outcome measures criteria.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Since the introduction of CQL and subsequent interviews with people about their goals and priorities, CLUOV has seen noticeable trends emerge. <strong>Chris Grayson</strong>, Executive Director for Community Living Upper Ottawa Valley, says they realized they hadn’t had much recent success in enabling people to choose where and with whom they wanted to live and where they wanted work.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">As a result, the partners have held a couple of symposiums that brought together about 80 people to look at issues around housing. A similar symposium was held around employment and brought 65 people to the table, including representatives from the local college, school boards, employment service providers, ODSP and Ontario Works.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Grayson feels it’s important to bring organizations together to work on issues of mutual interest, like housing and employment.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“The more you work with less familiar partners, the more integration you have. If we’re working with housing, they might not know much about what we do, but they have a housing mandate. At our symposium last year, we had a developer approach us and he’s just purchased one of our group homes. We’re getting out of the group home business and this gentleman was in the audience. He’s bought the group home and he’s going to convert it to housing, probably for students or nurses.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Grayson referenced another example of a builder that has changed his business model and is now focused exclusively on accessible housing.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“If we can make the community a better place by introducing choice through the outcome measures then, in the long run, I think all of us in the region will be better off.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">As a result of their involvement in the community, CLUOV has been asked to participate in the initiatives of others. The organization took part in the strategic plan of a nearby college, the planning process for the City of Pembroke, and they have had input with the local Accessibility Advisory Committee.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“This has made us a willing partner. We didn’t expect those things at the frontend, but they do happen because people get accustomed to you and our agency is prepared to play with other organizations,” adds Grayson.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">As part of the organization’s strategic plan, he says CLUOV is also taking steps to become fully accredited in 2016 through CQL.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“On any given day, there are stresses, pressures and things that can go wrong. But if you look at those 21 outcome measures and commit to doing your best in all those areas, people’s lives will change for the better.”</p>

				<title>Compass Provides Kelly with Employment Opportunity</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>Kelly Bosshart</strong> likes to work with numbers. In her previous roles as an accounting assistant and office assistant, she handled large sums of money, processed invoices and handled vast amounts of information. When the Brampton woman was looking for a job this past summer prior to enrolling in the Office Administration, Medical program at <strong>Sheridan College</strong>, she was successful in securing a position with <strong>Compass Group Canada</strong>. Based in Mississauga, the company is a leader in food and support services, employing over 26,000 people across the country.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Bosshart was able to make the connection thanks to her previous experience, as well as through her involvement with the <strong>Redpath Centre</strong> and <strong><a style="color: #0074c8;" href="http://eblast.gotenzing.com/t/r-l-zjutiz-l-e/">Ready, Willing &amp; Able</a></strong>. A collaboration between the<strong><a style="color: #0074c8;" href="http://eblast.gotenzing.com/t/r-l-zjutiz-l-s/">Canadian Association for Community Living</a></strong>, the <strong><a style="color: #0074c8;" href="http://eblast.gotenzing.com/t/r-l-zjutiz-l-g/">Canadian Autism Spectrum Disorders Alliance</a></strong> and partners including Community Living Ontario, Ready, Willing &amp; Able is a national initiative focused on increasing the labour force participation of job seekers with intellectual disabilities or who are on the autism spectrum.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Within a two-week period, Bosshart’s job coach submitted her resume to Ready,<a href="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/compass.144922.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-479" src="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/compass.144922-300x177.jpg" alt="compass.144922" width="300" height="177" /></a> Willing &amp; Able, she was interviewed for the position and Bosshart was hired shortly after. Over the course of the summer, Bosshart worked in the Diversity office, gathering and recording important data, which she enjoyed a great deal.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“You had to know how to manage your time and to make sure that you were getting things done as efficiently and productively as possible. [The workplace] was very conducive to being productive. I didn’t feel any stress or anxiety like, ‘Oh, I’m not going to get this done on time.’”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>Gaynor Feltmate</strong> is the Diversity and Inclusion Specialist for Compass Group Canada, and she was also Kelly’s supervisor. In addition to being approachable and hard working, Feltmate says Bosshart was willing to take on any task.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“I was impressed with Kelly’s professionalism and the dedication to her job. Feedback from her co-workers was really positive.”<!--more--></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Feltmate adds that inclusive hiring is part of Compass’ philosophy, and looking at all potential areas of employment is important to accommodate and support their employees so that they realize their potential and contribute to the company’s success.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“Working with Ready, Willing &amp; Able has enabled us to tap into a pool of talented and capable individuals that, otherwise, we would not have had access to. We gave them the criteria and job description and they did the rest. They went through their pool of individuals to identify suitable candidates. We anticipate that our continued involvement with Ready, Willing &amp; Able will open the door to more associates being identified and hired to support our business needs.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Once she completes her program, Bosshart hopes to continue to pursue her career in office administration or to seek out a position that would allow her to travel. Looking back, she was very appreciative of the whole experience.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“It was a great opportunity and I really enjoyed working for Compass. I’m grateful that Ready, Willing &amp; Able was able to assist me with getting a summer job. They were incredibly helpful.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">October is National Disability Employment Awareness Month, an occasion to educate the business community about the barriers to employment for people with intellectual disabilities or ASD and to celebrate the gains made in inclusive employment.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Did you know that of the more than 500,000 people with intellectual disabilities or ASD in Canada, only one in four are gainfully employed? Yet, 75% or more of employers rate their workers with intellectual disabilities or ASD as good to very good on most performance indicators. The average turnover rate in Canada for workers across all industries is 49%, and the rate for workers with intellectual disabilities is 7%. There are virtually no exceptional costs to hiring someone with an intellectual disability or ASD.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Become an inclusive employer like Compass Group Canada. Visit Ready, Willing &amp; Able’s <strong><a style="color: #0074c8;" href="http://eblast.gotenzing.com/t/r-l-zjutiz-l-w/">web site</a></strong> to see how you can get started. Better yet, contact a Labour Market Facilitator to learn about Ready, Willing &amp; Able’s hiring process:</p>

				<title>Together, One Dream: A Collaborative Approach to Supporting People</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="color: #000000;"><img class="alignleft" src="http://i2.createsend1.com/ei/r/4C/93B/6B0/csimport/newday.104846.jpg" alt="" width="310" height="184" /></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Earlier this year, we featured a story about <strong><a style="color: #0074c8;" href="http://communitylivingessex.org/">Community Living Essex County</a></strong> and its relationships with key stakeholders that enable the organization to provide individualized and flexible support to people with intellectual disabilities and their families.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">We recently reconnected with the agency to get an update on their<em>Together, One Dream</em> model and how they’re looking to make it available to others.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Since 2000, Community Living Essex County has partnered with <strong><a style="color: #0074c8;" href="http://www.ensembleunderstands.com/">Ensemble</a></strong>, a parent-directed resource for families caring for someone with a disability, to make more informed organizational decisions and to enhance support, resources and services to the communities of Essex County.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“When we started, one of the main objectives was to have family leadership consultants who would connect families with families to empower them, and to do it in a way that only families can,” says<strong>Nancy Wallace-Gero</strong>, Executive Director of Community Living Essex County.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“At first, it was ‘Let’s try this out and see how it works.’ But, to be honest, it worked so well that it wasn’t very long after that the Board of Directors was quite prepared to embed this model in the organization in a way that Ensemble’s funding would be seen as part of our annual expenditures and something that was critical to the organization’s success.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">In 2004, <a style="color: #0074c8;" href="http://communitylivingessex.org/partners/new-day-leaders-of-today/"><strong>New Day - Leaders of Today</strong></a> was formed, a self-advocacy organization. It too plays a vital role in ensuring that the collective voice of people with intellectual disabilities is represented.<!--more--></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“Something was missing with only the family leadership group and the agency itself. You weren’t hearing from the people that were supported, so that’s where New Day came in,” says <strong>Ray Renaud</strong>, a member of the group. “We wanted to know what was going on and how we could help out and have a say”.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Wallace-Gero says that while the family connection is a critical one and brings a great deal of opportunities to families, New Day is the voice of the people that Community Living Essex County supports.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“A lot of New Day’s work is directed towards helping people find their voice, helping people learn how to make decisions and completely control their lives, and helping the agency understand what it really means to provide good support to people.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>Marilyn Godard</strong> is a member of Ensemble’s Advisory Committee, and she’s also the parent of an adult daughter with a significant disability. She says New Day not only provides a support to the agency, but the group also provides assistance to her as a parent.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“When I listen to them, I’m learning. ‘Oh, this is the perspective that they have.’ And it helps me get some direction for my own daughter, because she can’t tell me those things.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">As part of their commitment to the Together, One Dream model, Community Living Essex County’s Board of Directors makes funding and support resources available, but each organization, including New Day and Ensemble, has full control over the direction of their own work.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Now, thanks to a generous grant from <strong>Green Shield Canada</strong>, the partners have developed tools that allow them to share the concept and their successes with others. Over the last month, they have presented their model at Community Living Ontario’s annual conference in Hamilton and the Claiming Full Citizenship conference in Vancouver. A video has also been created to highlight the benefits of the partnership.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“People were very touched by the video in Hamilton and Vancouver,” says Godard. “We were asked on numerous occasions how to access the model, would we be willing to do a workshop, and would we be willing to provide training – we got that in both locations.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Wallace-Gero says in addition to using the grant money to create the video and presentation, some of the funding is being allocated for the development of tools and a how-to companion guide that will accompany the video. Other organizations will then be able to access the video and guide as part of a package when developing their own framework.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“It’s a relatively simple model when you look at it, but it isn’t happening everywhere. And we believe there are huge benefits to the partnerships and lessons that we’ve learned along the way that, if we share them with others, could help other communities consider a similar approach.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Godard adds, "We all need to connect and share; agencies providing supports to individuals living with disabilities, families and self-advocates; creative and meaningful supports ensuring lives that maximize potential and access to full citizenship. Together, One Dream.”</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In case you missed it, we have included video links from some of the sessions held at this year's Annual Conference.

<hr />

&nbsp;

<b>S.T.A.R. - Rights and Abuse Training</b>

Stop Think Act Report (S.T.A.R.) is a program that focuses on rights and abuse training that is presented in an interactive manner. It concentrates on five forms of abuse; Verbal, Physical, Sexual, Financial, and Neglect. They empower the people receiving the training on how to recognize abuse, stand up for themselves, report the abuse and get out of abusive situations. Additionally, they discuss rights and responsibilities and how the two are equally important in everyday life.

The session was run by a team of three self-advocate and two staff mentors from the People Helping People Achieve group. They discussed the five types of abuse and take time focusing on each one and how to respond to abuse. This interactive workshop included games, Q &amp; A, role play, videos and a PowerPoint presentation.

<strong>PEDCC Session - </strong><strong>From Sheltered Programs to Competitive Employment and Building a Full and Rich Life</strong>

This session explored the current state of employment services for people with an intellectual disability and how to create meaningful opportunities to enrich people’s lives beyond their work day. Panelists discussed employment in detail – the opportunities, current strategies to engage employers, the ideal service delivery model, what success looks like and transition strategies in moving from sheltered program models. The session also explored other community-based opportunities that help comprise a full and rich life.

&nbsp;

<b>What’s on Your Mind?</b>

In this interactive session, attendees were asked to participate in discussions on priority topics identified by the Council: Bullying and Euthanasia (Assisted Suicide). This session included group brainstorming, sharing of personal views and experiences, debates and concluded with ideas on how to address each issue. Attendees were given the option to join an email list in order to receive updates regarding the progress of the plans and ideas discussed. The Council  also used this opportunity to introduce themselves and relay the importance the role of Council plays within local associations and province wide.

				<title>Empowering Students to Become Agents of Change</title>

<p style="color: #000000;"><strong><a style="color: #0074c8;" href="http://eblast.gotenzing.com/t/r-l-zijkjkt-l-k/" target="_blank">Community Living Ontario</a></strong>’s youth leadership initiative <strong><a style="color: #0074c8;" href="http://eblast.gotenzing.com/t/r-l-zijkjkt-l-u/" target="_blank">Re:Action4Inclusion</a></strong> continues to develop a strong network of young people that are committed to advocating for and alongside their peers who have an intellectual disability, both inside and outside the classroom.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">A key component in creating awareness around advocacy is the Re:Action4Inclusion conference, held annually in Orillia. This year’s event, which takes place on <strong>November 20th to the 22nd</strong>, will provide students with a weekend of networking, exciting guest speakers and workshops that enables them to become powerful agents of change in their own communities.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Many of Community Living Ontario’s member associations, like <strong><a style="color: #0074c8;" href="http://eblast.gotenzing.com/t/r-l-zijkjkt-l-o/" target="_blank">South-East Grey Support Services </a></strong>and <strong><a style="color: #0074c8;" href="http://eblast.gotenzing.com/t/r-l-zijkjkt-l-b/" target="_blank">Community Living Grimsby, Lincoln and West Lincoln</a></strong>, support young people to attend the conference and see it as an opportunity for youth to become engaged in the conversation around inclusion.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“They can create change in the culture of their school and that change does not have to be created strictly by school boards, principals or teachers, but can be achieved by the students themselves,” says<strong>Marsha Ferguson</strong>, Executive Assistant with South-East Grey Support Services.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">She says that by participating in the conference, students are engaging with their peers and gaining a perspective that they may not have experienced otherwise. Ferguson adds that students soon realize that there are others also wanting to influence the way that society views individuals with a disability.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“With having the experience of meeting youth leaders that have been diagnosed with a disability and seeing how successful they are, once given the opportunity to succeed, the students are able to see the potential that all youth have, with or without a disability.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>Debra Grieve-Knight</strong>, Community Partnership Coordinator with Community Living Grimsby, Lincoln and West Lincoln, says her association actively connects with secondary schools to promote the Re:Action4Inclusion conference and encourages students to participate.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Over the years, Grieve-Knight says they have sponsored more than 40 students to attend the conference, because it brings together high school students from across the province and challenges them to look closely at how attitudes and actions shape a community.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“This conference also inspires youth to be the catalyst that promotes positive changes of the attitudes and actions in their community. Our agency is honoured to have the opportunity to support the Re:Action4Inclusion movement and proud to be a part of empowering youth to make important and positive societal change.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Ferguson says students in her area that participated in last year’s conference are working on change projects at Grey Highlands Secondary School in Flesherton and inspiring others to become more inclusive.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“They have taken what they have learned from the conference and worked together to create a more inclusive and welcoming environment within their school, as well as to help educate their peers. These change projects are creating a domino effect, inspiring others to also become more inclusive.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">She feels strongly that without having attended the conference, students would not have been as inspired or driven to make this change or have had the tools to know how to become youth advocates.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Grieve-Knight says students from her area returned from the conference with a new outlook on equality, rights, respect and dignity.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“Our agency feels that by supporting Re:Action4Inclusion, we are making an immediate positive impact in our community and are laying the groundwork that will shape the future. The conference can inspire the youth in their community to individually and collectively promote inclusion and to be part of a movement that is focused on students working together to strive for an educational experience that truly recognizes and celebrates the abilities of all students.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Ferguson, a Re:Action4Inclusion ally who has attended the conference in the past, finds it inspiring to witness the passion and drive of students that participate.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“Seeing students that are so excited about including their peers with a disability reinforces that the message being sent about inclusion from Community Living Ontario, as well as local associations is being heard by today’s youth.”</p>

				<title>Class Action Settlement Reached Involving Former Residents of a Dozen Institutions</title>
		<link>http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/?p=519</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/institutions.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-520 size-medium" src="http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/CLO_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/institutions-300x142.jpg" alt="institutions" width="300" height="142" /></a>

A tentative agreement has been reached in a class action lawsuit involving the Ontario government and former residents of <strong>12 institutions</strong> in the province.

The deal was made public yesterday (November 12) and the province has agreed to pay $36 million to settle the class action, which includes claims, class proceedings fund levy, legal costs and disbursements.

The suit alleged that the province was negligent in the management and operation of the facilities, resulting in abuse and harm to former residents.

The Ontario Superior Court of Justice must still approve the proposed settlement agreement. According to Koskie Minsky’s website, the firm representing former residents, a hearing will take place in the coming months, however no specific date was given.

The tentative deal is very similar to the class action settlements for former residents of <strong>Huronia</strong>, <strong>Rideau</strong> and <strong>Southwestern Regional Centres</strong>. Those agreements totalled $67.7 million.

Like in the previous settlements, claimants will have to fill out a form consisting of two sections, A and B. Section A will require that former residents declare they suffered harm while living at one of the 12 institutions. Section B will allow to people to make specific allegations of harm, however they will be required to provide details of the harm suffered and any supporting documents, if available.

Compensation amounts will be determined using a Points Allocation System. The maximum amount each person can receive is $35,000 for each facility. A claims administrator will determine the points assigned, based on the form and supporting documents. Claimants who complete only Section A will receive $2,000.

Former residents will also be able to request their personal files from the province in order to submit their claims.

As part of the previous settlements, commemorative plaques were installed at or near Huronia, Southwestern and Rideau Regional Centres to honour the memory of the former residents. No such stipulation was outlined in the tentative agreement.

The proposed members of the class action are people alive as of <strong>June 16, 2012</strong> and who lived at the following institutions over a speficic period of time:
<ul>
	<li>Adult Occupational Centre (Edgar), between January 1, 1966 and March 31, 1999</li>
	<li>Bluewater Centre (Goderich), between April 1, 1976 and December 20, 1983</li>
	<li>D'Arcy Place (Cobourg), between September 1, 1963 and December 31, 1996</li>
	<li>Durham Centre for the Developmentally Handicapped (Whitby), between April 1, 1974 and September 28, 1986</li>
	<li>L.S. Penrose Centre (Kingston), between April 1, 1974 and March 31, 1977</li>
	<li>Midwestern Regional Centre (Palmerston), between September 1, 1963 and March 31, 1998</li>
	<li>Muskoka Centre (Gravenhurst), between August 28, 1973 and June 30, 1993</li>
	<li>Northwestern Regional Centre (Thunder Bay), between April 1, 1974 and March 31, 1994</li>
	<li>Oxford Mental Health Centre (Woodstock), between January 1, 1969 and March 31, 1974</li>
	<li>Oxford Regional Centre (Woodstock), between April 1, 1974 and March 31, 1996</li>
	<li>Pine Ridge Centre (Aurora), between September 1, 1963 and August 31, 1984</li>
	<li>Prince Edward Heights (Picton), between January 1, 1971 and December 31, 1999</li>
	<li>St. Lawrence Regional Centre (Brockville), between April 1, 1975 and June 30, 1983.</li>
</ul>

				<title>Innovative Housing Solutions Given Spotlight at Forum</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="color: #000000;"><img class="alignleft" src="http://i3.createsend1.com/ei/r/5E/2BE/B9E/csimport/housing.014523.jpg" alt="" width="353" height="209" /></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The need to address the crisis in affordable and appropriate housing options for adults with intellectual disabilities was front and centre at a housing forum held earlier this week in Toronto.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Hosted by the <strong>Inspired by Our Grassroots Steering Committee</strong>, the <strong>Provincial Executive Directors Coordinating Committee</strong> and <a style="color: #0074c8;" href="http://eblast.gotenzing.com/t/r-l-zdhpo-l-p/"><strong>Community Living Ontario</strong></a>, <em>Ideas to Build On</em> was an extension of last year’s housing forum.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Attendees heard from representatives from the <strong>Ministry of Community and Social Services</strong>, the <strong>Developmental Services Housing Task Force</strong> and 10 of 12 recently announced pilot projects.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The presentations throughout the day allowed people to learn more about the various innovative and collaborative initiatives taking place across the province.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>Mary Kopcok</strong> was part of the delegation from Windsor-Essex that received $870,000 over two years for their project, <em>Continuing Housing Innovation in Windsor-Essex</em>.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The funding will enable homes to be either purchased or renovated and secondary suites created. Rent supplements and housing allowances will also be made available to some of the participants.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The initiative is being led by the <strong>Windsor-Essex Innovative Housing Project Advisory Group</strong>, a partnership that includes <strong><a style="color: #0074c8;" href="http://eblast.gotenzing.com/t/r-l-zdhpo-l-x/">Community Living Windsor</a></strong>, the <strong>City of Windsor</strong>, <strong><a style="color: #0074c8;" href="http://eblast.gotenzing.com/t/r-l-zdhpo-l-m/">Windsor-Essex Brokerage for Personal Supports</a></strong> and the <strong><a style="color: #0074c8;" href="http://eblast.gotenzing.com/t/r-l-zdhpo-l-c/">Windsor-Essex Family Network</a></strong>.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Kopcok is a Board member with the Windsor-Essex Family Network and the sister of 29-year-old <strong>Matthew</strong>, one of eight people involved in the project. She was pleased that there’s recognition that families are looking for different options and “something innovative that doesn’t necessarily fall within traditionally funded support from MCSS, in terms of providing housing and supports to adults with intellectual disabilities.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">With the project funding, the family home will be renovated to include a secondary suite for Matthew, something his sister says they’re excited about.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“We’ve always tried to keep Matt in community and as part of our family. We include him in everything and segregated programs have never appealed to him or us, and so we’re very fortunate for the timing of this. It seems to coincide, essentially, with the time we’re thinking Matt wants a place of his own.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>Mike Town</strong>, Executive Director of <strong><a style="color: #0074c8;" href="http://eblast.gotenzing.com/t/r-l-zdhpo-l-q/">Community Living North Perth</a></strong>, was surprised at the variety of projects that were presented, and he’s looking forward to hearing about the outcomes and what can be shared.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“They were all very different and there are a lot of little pieces that we can all take away from. I’m from a rural town in Listowel, and to be able to afford to live on your own, but yet have some supports in your life, is sometimes hard to come by.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Community Living North Perth and <strong>Habitat for Humanity</strong> received $60,000 in funding over two years to create an affordable housing option for two gentlemen with intellectual disabilities. Habitat for Humanity will build a semi-detached house where they will live on their own and a family will occupy the other half.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“Habitat for Humanity provides houses for people that have income difficulties and they are going to help our organization with the mortgage,” added Town. “It’ll be interest free, which will help the gentlemen afford, based on their ODSP capabilities, to live in an affordable house that’s brand new.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>Sandra McNamara</strong>, Executive Director of <strong><a style="color: #0074c8;" href="http://eblast.gotenzing.com/t/r-l-zdhpo-l-a/">Community Living North Grenville</a></strong>, also attended the forum. She says her association is trying to determine whether it will continue to offer residential supports or provide strictly support services.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“I’m really interested in how you create a separate entity or a housing task force or a housing corporation, and not just for us, but for affordable housing in our own community.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">McNamara says her organization did not submit one of the 80 proposals during the first round of expressions of interest, but she does anticipate putting forward a proposal for the next round.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">She also sees the discussion on housing as an opportunity for community partnerships and “working with builders, our township and mental health service providers, with a focus to bring them all together to determine how to build affordable housing in North Grenville.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The second call for expressions of interest is expected in the coming months. <strong>Ron Pruessen</strong>, Chair of the Developmental Services Housing Task Force, says they will be making a recommendation to the Ministry of Community and Social Services on dates for the announcement and deadline for proposals.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“[The process] went pretty smoothly the last time. My guess is that probably after Friday’s meeting (November 13), we may need another two to three, maybe even four weeks, depending on how things are backed up at the Ministry level to get the formal approval for the announcement date and the proposal deadline. I would find it very hard to imagine that we won’t have the announcement by the middle of December, and that we won’t have a proposal deadline at some point in February.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">During his presentation, Pruessen encouraged attendees to continue to pressure the government by advocating and coming up with new ideas. He also shared that he’s confident one of the Task Force’s recommendations to the Ministry of Community and Social Services will be that it continue in some capacity.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“Something like the Housing Task Force, people outside of the Ministry with a wide range of experience, need to keep contributing to the discussion, making recommendations and continue to have resources to work with. I find it hard to imagine that the Ministry wouldn’t see the logic of that. Technically speaking this is a two-year initiative, the Housing Task Force, but I have a strong feeling that it’s going to continue after that.”</p>

				<title>Start Advocacy for Inclusion with Children</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="color: #000000;"><img class="alignleft" src="http://i3.createsend1.com/ei/r/C9/D62/AC4/csimport/Continis.121029.JPG" alt="" width="329" height="228" />“This is my life now.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">That’s how <strong>Luciano Contini</strong> describes his role as parent and advocate for his six-year-old son, <strong>Peter</strong>.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The self-employed Human Resources Consultant and Vice President of Community Living Ontario says his son’s birth has brought many joys and challenges to the family, which includes eight-year-old son, <strong>John</strong>, and wife, <strong>Julie</strong>.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Luciano became involved with Community Living Ontario as a prior presenter on advocacy at the Confederation’s Conference and AGM; he recently completed his first full year on the Board. He says the organization’s mandate “matches my vision of inclusion for my son.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“I want him to live the life that he wants to live and not have his life or his environment dictated to him; not having him forced into a template because he is challenged. Inclusion is all about having him in the community as a participating member of society, living the life the way he wants to live it,” he adds.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The Continis know travelling the path toward full inclusion is a lifelong and often frustrating process, but they are undaunted.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">For example, finding a fully-inclusive school environment for Peter in the public or Catholic school systems in their hometown of Sudbury was not possible. The public system wasn’t ready for him, says Luciano, and the Catholic board said Peter could attend a regular class, but any time he would require personal care, Luciano or Julie would have to leave work and assist him themselves.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“That flies in the face of respect, dignity, human rights and the rights of the individual. He’s entitled to be in a class with his peers.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">He knows their choice to enrol Peter in a Montessori school, which they believe is built on inclusion, is not an option for many parents, but there’s a stark difference between the traditional school boards in Sudbury and Montessori.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">At his son’s school, “I call myself Peter’s dad, because when kids see Peter they don’t see a kid with Down syndrome; whereas in the public system they see a kid that looks different and possibly expectations are that they should be segregated because the kids who look different are segregated in schools. [The children at Montessori] don’t see Peter at all that way. This is human nature. Peter is a friend. They replicate the behaviour being modelled by the educators – compassion, patience, and they redirect Peter correctly because they have learned to do so correctly.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Still, the Continis haven’t given up on the public school system.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><!--more-->“We’re not there yet, but that is kind of in the plan. We’ve put them on notice that Peter is coming. None of them said they are prepared for Peter. None of them said ‘we are ready to go with Peter today.’ But they know that we are going to see them again and that Peter is on his way in. They have time to prepare.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Luciano says other parents who are trying to have their child accommodated in a regular classroom have told them that the public school board knows “‘about you guys and they know you are coming.’ If they didn’t have a good feeling about us, I’m not sure they would have said that. I think they know we are advocating and to expect Peter because he belongs in a class with his peers."</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Peter’s parents say he is enjoying the life they want for him, because of the environment he is in right now.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“I’m not sure that in a segregated school system how many children with special needs can say they get up to 20 kids to a birthday party, because he is included and he has that many friends, and that’s what we want to see.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Luciano and Julie are actively engaged with Community Living Ontario because they know how the organization is advocating for Peter and people with an intellectual disability across Ontario.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“Younger families like ours should get involved because it’s just as important to guarantee inclusion for adults as it is for children. For me, it is critical for the sustainability of inclusion to start with children.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The attitudes of many today toward people with an intellectual disability are still negative, he acknowledges.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“Instead of seeing what people are capable of, we slide into caretaker mode and say 'they can’t take care of themselves' and 'they are a burden on society' and 'let’s just make sure they are safe and that’s good enough.' I think a lot of Community Living associations will say ‘we are great at keeping people safe and fed’ but we need to do more. We need to help these people live the lives they want to live, the good life.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">But the couple says this is a path they are walking, not just for their son, but for other families and that young families “need to understand that working for full inclusion is a lifelong process.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Advocating for full inclusion is one of the battles that Community Living Ontario needs to continue, they say. As Luciano notes, “That’s an area where Community Living Ontario should be more than happy to work itself out of a job. Get society to a point where we don’t need to convince people of inclusion anymore because it is obvious.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Julie, who works in human resources, labour relations and recruitment at Health Sciences North in their city, is a member of Community Living and President of the Down Syndrome Association of Sudbury.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“As a member, I like to hear about what’s happening now and what’s going to happen in the future,” she says.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“The wealth of information you can get through Community Living  - you can’t get that anywhere else. It is knowledge; it helps you in whatever barriers you are trying to overcome now regardless of how old Peter is. It is helping in preparation for his future, and knowledge is helpful. It is nice to know it is there. It is nice to know the services. It is nice to know what fight they are fighting, and what battle they are going after. And it is great to know all the successes that have been happening for decades.”</p>

<strong>A Message from the President</strong>

A vital donation to Community Living Ontario 2015 Holiday Appeal will help Community Living Ontario provide enhanced programming and greater advocacy to ensure people with an intellectual disability and their families have a true sense of belonging, equality and acceptance in their communities.

There a more than 12,000 people with an intellectual disability and their families who rely on the generosity of supporters like you. With your help, we will continue to draw attention to the needs of thousands of families across Ontario.

As Luciano says, “It’s time to focus on what’s right and to include. We’re not there yet but if we don’t have that as our goal, we are never going to improve.”

We thank you for your continued support and commitment to advocate, promote and facilitate the full participation, inclusion and citizenship of people with an intellectual disability – and that includes boys like Peter.

Sincerely yours,

<p style="color: #000000;">For those who are unfamiliar, <a style="color: #0074c8;" href="http://eblast.gotenzing.com/t/r-l-zuylhjk-l-k/"><strong>Re:Action4Inclusion</strong></a> is a Community Living Ontario-led initiative that strives to empower youth across the province to explore how they can influence the way society views and treats individuals who have an intellectual disability.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The conference was a huge success with 33 schools from 15 Boards of Education participating in the event. Both students, educators and other allies came together with the goal of exploring ideas that would make their high schools and communities more welcoming and inclusive.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Update Friday spoke with <strong>Kate Hewitt</strong>, a Re:Action4Inclusion Ambassador, about the impact of the activities on students.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“We had people leave with a plan in hand and ideas to change their community.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">As an Ambassador, Hewitt connects with high school students who are interested in talking about what they can do to promote inclusion in their communities.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The conference featured guest speakers <strong>Blake Fly</strong>, <strong>Norm Kunc</strong>,<strong>Carlos Aster Taguba</strong> and <strong>Nick Foley</strong>, all passionate and respected inclusion youth advocates.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“Everyone enjoyed the speakers. Their presentations were interactive and they really made everyone think about inclusion from different perspectives,” says Hewitt.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">With a theme set on motivating youth to take action, the workshops were effective in highlighting and exploring the ways in which youth can become champions for inclusion.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“Most people showed up on Friday knowing what the conference was about, but not exactly sure how they could make a difference afterwards. I think the workshops really helped participants understand how to take action and what they could do as individuals,” says Hewitt.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Although the conference is an annual event, Re:Action4Inclusion works day in and day out to empower youth and to ensure they have the necessary tools to unite their communities through inclusion.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Hewitt believes that this year’s message was clear - inclusion is possible but it requires students to step up and take action.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“I wanted them to know that, even as high school students, it’s possible to do something big.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Check out Re:Action4Inclusion on <strong><a style="color: #0074c8;" href="http://eblast.gotenzing.com/t/r-l-zuylhjk-l-u/">Facebook</a></strong> and <strong><a style="color: #0074c8;" href="http://eblast.gotenzing.com/t/r-l-zuylhjk-l-o/">Twitter</a></strong> to stay up to date on the latest news and upcoming events.</p>
