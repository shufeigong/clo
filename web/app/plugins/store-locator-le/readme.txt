= Details =

Store Locator Plus is an advanced system for managing multiple physical locations via a fully integrated WordPress solution.
Whether you have ten locations or ten-thousand, you manage them right from within your WordPress admin panel.
There is no special programming or extra setup required.
Simply enter your locations, create a page or edit an existing page and put the SLPLUS short code on it.
The Store Locator Plus search form and map will "magically" appear.

The base plugin, [available for free from the WordPress Plugin Directory](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/store-locator-le) has all the features you need
to create a comprehensive store locator interface on your website.
Set up an interactive Google map for your customers with a [single shortcode](http://www.storelocatorplus.com/support/documentation/store-locator-plus/getting-started/shortcodes/).

Advanced customization is available via the settings interface in the admin panel.
Set the map size to best fit your site.
Change map types (terrain, satellite, standard views).
Add details like a store description, hours, a website address, an email address.
Re-label entry fields and results fields.

Create something great and list it on the CSA site!   Revenue sharing offered for premium add-on packs.

= Support =

Support for the plugin can be found in the [Forums](http://www.storelocatorplus.com/forums/).  If you have an urgent issue or want one-on-one support you can [purchase premium support](http://www.storelocatorplus.com/product/product-support).

You can also view the [Product Documentation](http://www.storelocatorplus.com/support/documentation) for more information about the plugin including [known conflicts](http://www.storelocatorplus.com/support/documentation/technical-documentation/store-locator-plus/troubleshooting/known-conflicts/) with themes and plugins.

= Special Requests =

I accept feature requests for all plugins. The most requested features will make it into the next version if time permits.

If you need something NOW, or are looking for something beyond a basic "tweak" of the plugin, please check out the
[Customization Service](http://www.storelocatorplus.com/product/customization/).

= Upgrades and Patches =

I try to release at least one upgrade/patch every month.

The main product will always remain fully functional and free.

If you'd like to have some of the latest "bells & whistles" purchasing a premium add-on is a great way to help support product development.

= My Philosophy =

I strive to create code that runs efficiently and without bugs. Well-written plugins are few and far between. While there are plenty of plugins that look nice, many of those plugins, including the "cool shiny ones" have hidden problems. Over 90% of the plugins available on the WordPress plugin directory generate dozens, if not hundreds, of warnings and errors when you turn off the "hide all the problems" settings.

These hidden problems impact memory usage, fill up disk space, and reduce performance. While you may not see the errors on your WordPress site, they are still being tracked. The more errors, the more disk I/O, the slower the app.

During my 20 years of software development, I have found that leaving "innocuous" warnings in place tends to lead to trouble further down the road. Warnings today often become errors tomorrow. Many programming languages, PHP included, continue to tighten security and close loopholes that are typically found living near warning messages. Some warnings are telling you to "change this now, it will be gone tomorrow". Eventually tomorrow will come.

While my plugins may not be the prettiest on the block, I do try to make sure that all the hidden stuff you don't see is designed as well as it can be. My code is not perfect, but when I find a bug I try to fix it fast.  If I create a bug I try to fix it even faster.

I like to write plugins that last. I hope you appreciate my work.

= Rate This Plugin =

Please [rate this plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/store-locator-le/)!
Rating the plugin, hopefully with 5 stars, helps increase the exposure on WordPress, which generates more downloads and purchases of add-ons.
The more add-ons I sell the easier it is to put food on the table and give me more time to code cool new features.
No ratings, no food, more hours working as the Walmart Greeter, less coolness in the plugins.

Give me a chance to address your concerns if this plugin doesn't earn 5 stars by [contacting me](http://www.storelocatorplus.com/mindset/contact-us/) directly or by posting in the [support forum](http://www.storelocatorplus.com/forums/) at the CSA website.

== Installation ==

= Requirements =

* WordPress: 3.8
* jQuery: 1.7 (same as WordPress 3.3)
* PHP 5.2.4 (same as WordPress 3.2)
* MySQL 5.0.15 (same as WordPress 3.2)

= Main Plugin =

1. Search for "Store Locator Plus" via Plugins/Add New on your WordPress admin panel.
2. Click install.
3. Add your locations through the 'Add Locations' page in the Store Locator admin panel
4. Create or edit a page and add the [[SLPLUS] shortcode](http://www.storelocatorplus.com/support/documentation/store-locator-plus/getting-started/shortcodes/).

= Icons =

The system ships with a dozen default icons in the `/wp-content/plugins/store-locator-le/images/icons` directory. Add your own custom icons in that directory and they will be auto-detected.

To prevent custom icons from being over-written they will be copies to the '/wp-content/uploads/sl-uploads/custom-icons/' directory.  If you place your icons in that directory they will be detected on the icon selection screens.

= Custom Styling =

Users that want to customize the look and feel of the search form, map, and search results can do so using the built-in Theme System.   
Copy an existing CSS file, change the file name and update the CSS header, upload to the server and you can activate your new theme or any of the built-in defaults by selecting it from the auto-generated pulldown menu.

[Pro Pack](http://www.storelocatorplus.com/product/slp4-pro/) users can also add CSS rules via the Pro Pack CSS Rules entry on the admin panel.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is included in the plugin? =

The plugin includes all the functions and features necessary to add multiple locations to a store finder tool on your website.
List 1 location or 1,000, customize the search interface and results form, and more.
All basic functionality needed for a fully functional plugin is included.
Basic upgrades are free and available directly from the WordPress plugin repository.

= How do I report a bug? =

Post in the [support forum](http://www.storelocatorplus.com/forums/).
You can also [contact me](http://www.storelocatorplus.com/product/product-support) to request premium support if you need immediate assistance.

= What are the add-ons? =

In response to feature requests from customers, I created a series of add-on packages for Store Locator Plus.
These features extend the functionality of the plugin beyond the basic service and features and can be purchased ala-carte.
This gives those customers who want more out of the plugin the extra features they desire while keeping the main plugin as
efficient as possible for everyone else.   It also provides a great way to support future development while getting a
"little something extra" when contributing to the development of the product.

All plugins are true add-on packs.  They are non-destructive OPTIONAL additions to the base plugin.
They do not require the base plugin to be uninstalled or re-installed.
Installing an add-on pack will not change location data or modify base plugin settings.


= What are the terms of the license? =

The license is GPL.  You get the code, feel free to modify it as you
wish. I prefer that customers pay because they like what I do and
want to support the effort that brings useful software to market.  Learn more
on the [License Terms page](http://www.storelocatorplus.com/products/general-eula/).

= How can I translate the plugin into my language? =

Store Locator Plus is now part of the WordPress Translate system.

You can translate this readme file and the text strings in the main Store Locator Plus plugin by selecting the Stable sub-projects at [Translate.WordPress.Org](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/store-locator-le).

Once a language reaches 100% translated at the [Translating WordPress](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/store-locator-le) site, that specific language file can be removed from the distribution.
This makes the distribution smaller and thus takes less space on every install.
For sites that utilize one of the languages listed, the WordPress Core engine will fetch the Store Locator Plus language files from the [Translating WordPress](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/store-locator-le) site.

For the Store Locator Plus add-on packs, those language files are still distributed with each add-on pack.
Help translate a premium add-on pack and send the .po and .mo files to support@storelocatorplus.com.
For each complete translation file you send we will add a new premium add-on pack to your account.
Upon request I will also put a link to your site in the "special thanks" section.

Store Locator Plus has built-in interfaces for WPML compatibility.
We are continually working to improve our support for multi-lingual sites.
If you have comments or suggestions about language support, please email us at support@storelocatorplus.com.

* Enhancement: Extended data is now passed back in the marker exdata array in a name=>value format.   marker[data][exdata][rank].   Output with [slp_location exdata.rank], for example. (extended data is provided via various add-on packs)
* Enhancement: Tagalong categories (IDs not names) can now be accessed via the marker[categories] array.   This is an array of all the categories IDs assigned to each location. (requires Tagalong add-on)
* Enhancement: Tagalong category names is returned as a concatenated string in the marker[category_names] field.  (requires Tagalong add-on)
* Enhancement: Hours field is now a text field (allows > 255 characters).
* Enhancement: Cache the SLP Info tab for 24 hours to increase performance when accessing admin tabs multiple times on the same day.
* Enhancement: Manage Locations hides extended data fields on add/edit screen when the add-on that provides the fields is deactivated.
* Enhancement: Manage Locations add/edit screen has collapsible field groups for easier editing.
* Enhancement: Manage Locations has a new drag-and-drop interface for hiding location columns on the manage locations screen.
* Enhancement: AJAX handler now processes wp_die() instead of die() on termination to better follow WordPress best practices.

* Change: Manage Locations only has a single view, the expanded view mode.
* Change: Manage Locations details expander has been removed.
* Change: Find button images are no longer supported. Use CSS styling to modify the standard text button if you want custom image buttons or downgrade to SLP 4.2.67.
* Change: Move UX / Results / Website Label to a serialized option, remove it from the JavaScript parser as it is now handled on the AJAX Handler backend.
* Change: Remove custom zoom_level settings, make it a standard serialized option.
* Change: refactor much of the slp.js namespace and classes to follow current JavaScript best practices.  Eliminate class/object overhead on some simple function-only references.
* Change: No longer checks for , and deactivates, Super Extendo add-on pack.  If you are using that add-on pack you should not be.  Bad things happen.

* Fix: Apostrophe in manage locations search.
* Fix: Missing admin page stying on some add-on pack pages after saving options.
* Fix: The extended data field handler for the manage locations page fixing issues when extended data features would randomly disappear.
* Fix: slplus shortcode theme attributes changes CSS style for the locator page.  Does not change page layout for advanced layouts.

* Note: Some add-on packs will need to be upgraded to their latest 4.3 release to work properly with SLP 4.3.
